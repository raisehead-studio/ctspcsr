    "<strong>Stakeholder Identification and Communication Channels</strong>",
    "Through internal discussions with the heads of all units, and with reference to stakeholder groups identified by businesses within the same industry as well as other benchmark enterprises, the CTSP Bureau adopted the 5 principles of the AA1000 AccountAbility Stakeholder Engagement Standard to identify 9 types of stakeholders and their scoring and prioritization.",
    "<div class='page_photo_container'><img alt='' src='/images/en_image/goal/g17.png'  title=''></div>",
    "11/9/2023 The CTSP Bureau makes use of the official CTSP website, CTSP Corporate Sustainability website, CTSP Facebook fan page, CTSP News Facebook public group, CTSP Annual Reports, CTSP Newsletter, and the CTSP Sustainability Report (originally called the Corporate Sustainability Report) etc. for formal communication and exchanges with the outside world, while other channels are also utilized to understand stakeholders’issues of concern and provide relevant responses and explanations. An English version of the Corporate Sustainability Report was issued in 2020, while the English version of the website was also published online for a more international outlook, allowing more diverse stakeholders access to the current situation and sustainable activities of the Bureau.",
    "<div class='page_photo_container'><img alt='' src='/images/en_image/goal/g18.png'  title=''></div>",
    "In addition to communication with various stakeholders through daily operations, the Bureau has also set up an email contact address for the Director-General, a whistle- blower hotline and email address (Tel: 04-2565-8588 ext. 6801 or discipline@ctsp.gov. tw) to facilitate convenient public communication. In 2021, the CTSP Bureau received a total of 180 petitions, among which 13 were administrative reform proposals, 7 inquiries on administrative laws, 51 reports of administrative violations, and 109 cases of administrative rights protection.",

    "<strong>Park Manufacturer Satisfaction Survey</strong>",
    "Opinions expressed by manufacturers are an important basis for the CTSP Bureau to improve or enhance the various services of the Park. In addition to the satisfaction survey and the tracking of the reflected opinions, the industry management team is instructed to complete the improvements as soon as possible. The bureau organizes a working group to handle manufacturer visits every year. However, in response to the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, in 2021 the CTSP Bureau instead sent a letter to solicit opinions from manufacturers.",
    "In order to ensure fair, objective and consistent service quality evaluation indicators, to encourage the Bureau to pay attention to the satisfaction of its service targets, and to achieve the purpose of improving service quality, the Ministry of Science and Technology commissions a professional survey company to conduct a satisfaction survey every year. The CTSP's 2021 manufacturer's 「overall satisfaction」 score was 87.36, and the satisfaction of the six dimensions was the highest in the three Science Parks, among which the 「Park Image」 score was the highest. The bureau would actively respond to and deal with the relevant feedback from manufacturers, and track and control them. It has reached the customer-oriented customer satisfaction goal, and has strived for their support and trust to the Park. In the future, we will continue to pay attention to the needs of manufacturers to get more affirmations and positive comments from manufacturers. In addition, a survey was also conducted on the surrounding residents to understand the evaluation of the surrounding residents on the Park.",
