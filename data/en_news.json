    "news_content": "<p>08 NOV 2023 / PRESS RELEASE / CLIMATE ACTION</p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20231207_m_en/2.png' style='width: 100%;' /></p><p>Stockholm, 8 November 2023 – A major new report published today finds that governments plan to produce around 110% more fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, and 69% more than would be consistent with 2°C.<br /><br />This comes despite 151 national governments having pledged to achieve net-zero emissions and the latest forecasts which suggest global coal, oil, and gas demand will peak this decade, even without new policies. When combined, government plans would lead to an increase in global coal production until 2030, and in global oil and gas production until at least 2050, creating an ever-widening fossil fuel production gap over time.<br /><br />The report’s main findings include:<br /><br />Given risks and uncertainties of carbon capture and storage and carbon dioxide removal, countries should aim for a near total phase-out of coal production and use by 2040, and a combined reduction in oil and gas production and use by three-quarters by 2050 from 2020 levels, at a minimum.<br /><br />While 17 of the 20 countries featured have pledged to achieve net-zero emissions — and many have launched initiatives to cut emissions from fossil fuel production activities — none have committed to reduce coal, oil, and gas production in line with limiting warming to 1.5°C.<br /><br />Governments with greater capacity to transition away from fossil fuels should aim for more ambitious reductions and help support the transition processes in countries with limited resources.<br /><br />The 2023 Production Gap Report: “Phasing down or phasing up? Top fossil fuel producers plan even more extraction despite climate promises” is produced by Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Climate Analytics, E3G, International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). It assesses governments’ planned and projected production of coal, oil, and gas against global levels consistent with the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal.<br /><br />「Governments are literally doubling down on fossil fuel production; that spells double trouble for people and planet,」 said UN Secretary-General António Guterres. 「We cannot address climate catastrophe without tackling its root cause: fossil fuel dependence. COP28 must send a clear signal that the fossil fuel age is out of gas — that its end is inevitable. We need credible commitments to ramp up renewables, phase out fossil fuels, and boost energy efficiency, while ensuring a just, equitable transition.」<br /><br />July 2023 was the hottest month ever recorded, and most likely the hottest for the past 120,000 years, according to scientists. Across the globe, deadly heat waves, droughts, wildfires, storms, and floods are costing lives and livelihoods, making clear that human-induced climate change is here. Global carbon dioxide emissions — almost 90% of which come from fossil fuels — rose to record highs in 2021–2022.<br /><br />「Governments’ plans to expand fossil fuel production are undermining the energy transition needed to achieve net-zero emissions, throwing humanity’s future into question,」said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. 「Powering economies with clean and efficient energy is the only way to end energy poverty and bring down emissions at the same time.」<br /><br />「Starting at COP28, nations must unite behind a managed and equitable phase-out of coal, oil and gas — to ease the turbulence ahead and benefit every person on this planet,」 she added.<br /><br />The 2023 Production Gap Report provides newly expanded country profiles for 20 major fossil-fuel-producing countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Mexico, Nigeria, Norway, Qatar, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America. These profiles show that most of these governments continue to provide significant policy and financial support for fossil fuel production.<br /><br />「We find that many governments are promoting fossil gas as an essential ‘transition’ fuel but with no apparent plans to transition away from it later,」 says Ploy Achakulwisut, a lead author on the report and SEI scientist. “But science says we must start reducing global coal, oil, and gas production and use now — along with scaling up clean energy, reducing methane emissions from all sources, and other climate actions — to keep the 1.5°C goal alive.” <br /><br />Despite being the root cause of the climate crisis, fossil fuels have remained largely absent from international climate negotiations until recent years. At COP26 in late 2021, governments committed to accelerate efforts towards “the phasedown of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies”, though they did not agree to address the production of all fossil fuels.<br /><br />「COP28 could be the pivotal moment where governments finally commit to the phase-out of all fossil fuels and acknowledge the role producers have to play in facilitating a managed and equitable transition,」 says Michael Lazarus, a lead author on the report and SEI US Centre Director. 「Governments with the greatest capacities to transition away from fossil fuel production bear the greatest responsibility to do so while providing finance and support to help other countries do the same.」<br /><br />More than 80 researchers, from over 30 countries, contributed to the analysis and review, spanning numerous universities, think tanks and other research organizations.<br /><br />Reactions to the 2023 Production Gap Report<br /><br />「The writing’s on the wall for fossil fuels. By mid-century we need to have consigned coal to the history books, and slashed oil and gas production by at least three quarters — well on the way to a full fossil phase-out. Yet despite their climate promises, governments plan on ploughing yet more money into a dirty, dying industry, while opportunities abound in a flourishing clean energy sector. On top of economic insanity, it is a climate disaster of our own making.」<br /><br />– Neil Grant, Climate and Energy Analyst, Climate Analytics<br /><br />「Despite governments around the world signing up to ambitious net zero targets, global coal, oil and gas production are all still increasing while planned reductions are nowhere near enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change. This widening gulf between governments' rhetoric and their actions is not only undermining their authority but increasing the risk to us all. We are already on track this decade to produce 460% more coal, 82% more gas, and 29% more oil than would be in line with the 1.5°C warming target. Ahead of COP28, governments must look to dramatically increase transparency about how they will hit emissions targets and bring in legally binding measures to support these aims.」<br /><br />– Angela Picciariello, Senior Researcher, IISD <br /><br />「With demand for coal, oil and gas set to peak this decade even without additional policies, it’s clear that the new economic reality is becoming one of clean energy growth and fossil fuel decline — yet governments are failing to plan for the reality of the inevitable energy transition. Continuing investments into new fossil fuel production as global demand for coal, oil and gas narrows is a near term economic gamble for all but the cheapest producers. And climate damages will be aggravated further unless we stop fossil fuel expansion now. The time is now for governments to take control of the clean energy transition and align their policies with the reality of what’s needed for a climate-safe world.」<br /><br />– Katrine Petersen, Senior Policy Advisor at E3G<br /><br />NOTES TO EDITORS<br /><br />About the Production Gap Report<br /><br />Modelled after the UNEP’s Emissions Gap Report series — and conceived as a complementary analysis — this report conveys the large discrepancy between countries' planned fossil fuel production and the global production levels consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C and 2°C.<br /><br />About the Stockholm Environment Institute<br /><br />Stockholm Environment Institute is an independent, international research institute that has been engaged in environment and development issues at local, national, regional and global policy levels for more than a quarter of a century.

However, with passenger mobility demand set to increase, electrification alone will not suffice and must be coupled with increasing transport efficiency. Furthermore, increasing restrictions on the circulation of ICE vehicles in urban centers, new mobility solutions enabled by emerging technologies and new commuting patterns are setting the stage for a new mobility paradigm.<br /><br />Urban transport planners, mobility providers and businesses with sustainable employee mobility strategies are striving to promote sustainable new mobility solutions. How can they facilitate commuter’s shift to sustainable transport modes (modal shift)? And what infrastructure and policies should they prioritize for maximum impact?<br /><br />Mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) is an emerging digital mobility solution that can radically improve transport efficiency by integrating multiple transport modes into a more efficient and user-centered mobility offer. The real environmental impact of MaaS will depend on its ability to motivate modal shift and commuter choices at a large scale.<br /><br />In a new digital collaboration initiative announced today by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Transport & Mobility Pathway, Arcadis and Fujitsu have developed digital solutions for municipalities and businesses to optimize the deployment of multimodality and new mobility solutions with regards to modal shift and sustainable mobility.<br /><br />The use cases will apply Arcadis’ Mobility Hubs module and Fujitsu’s Social Digital Twin technology. They will test how different transport planning scenarios promote multimodal and sustainable commuting. The scenarios under study are adjusted parking fees and the creation of mobility hubs, to be evaluated based on their effect on modal shift and associated cost and time of travel and transport-related emissions. The simulation will be carried out in the Greater London Region with data from Transport for the South-East (TfSE) and Michelin Mobility Intelligence. Results from an initial simulation by Fujitsu demonstrated potential for 12% CO2 reduction through commuters’ shift to more sustainable transport modes.<br /><br />Data sharing and digital collaboration to maximize the impact of MaaS<br /><br />Digital collaboration among all MaaS stakeholders will ensure that cities and MaaS operators can expand the scope of mobility services to facilitate traveler access and maximize transport efficiency and decarbonization benefits.<br /><br />With extensive access to disaggregated data from across the spectrum of MaaS stakeholders, cities and mobility providers can design MaaS based on more accurate predictions of mobility patterns and how they are set to evolve.<br /><br />Besides the basic functional blocks to facilitate route planning, MaaS operators can create valuable additional service modules by integrating assets such as user profiles for personalization or booking and payment platforms to centralize ticketing.<br /><br />Although often left out of MaaS design, private car data is an essential module. Transport planners need a better understanding of the needs and preferences of drivers – particularly in more remote or underserved regions – to effectively influence modal choice and optimize infrastructure investments in the electric vehicle (EV) era. MaaS operators can significantly contribute to sustainable mobility strategies by integrating EV charging locations and pre-booking in their service offerings.<br /><br />Private car data integration is a key element of the collaborative digital solutions developed by Arcadis and Fujitsu.<br /><br />“It’s been a pleasure working with Fujitsu, Michelin Mobility Intelligence and TfSE and we recognise the importance of working collaboratively with organisations to accelerate a planet positive future. Private car use data is often a missing ingredient of MaaS applications, but the reality is that many people continue to rely on their car in part for some journeys. We wanted to explore how including this data could influence peoples travel behaviour in a multimodal digital environment to optimize the environmental and social impact of these journeys,” commented Simon Swan, Global Solutions Director, New Mobility at Arcadis.<br /><br />What's next?<br /><br />Thanks to seamless integration and the right digital solutions for modeling, cities and businesses can harness the full potential of MaaS as an accelerator of their respective Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans and sustainable commuting policies.<br /><br />Mayors, governors and parliamentarians, business and civil society leaders will gather for COP28 in Dubai and agree on the next climate action steps, with a thematic focus on transport scheduled for December 6. They must integrate new digital and mobility solutions, such as MaaS, as powerful tools for sustainable mobility. Integrating digitalization in transport decarbonization pathways starts with the introduction of the right digital governance frameworks, and with investments in governments and businesses’ capacity to engage in data sharing and digital collaboration.<br /><br />The WBCSD Transport & Mobility Pathway gathers companies to accelerate transport decarbonization and promote data sharing and digitalization as core solutions for the transition to sustainable mobility. Fifteen of our member companies are building a data-sharing coalition to bolster new digital solutions for the transition to zero-emission mobility. Earlier this year, they demonstrated how digital collaboration across the electric mobility value chain could accelerate the deployment of charging infrastructure toward transport climate goals. In early 2024, they will release a digital framework for accelerating the deployment of MaaS, promoting sustainable urban mobility.

    "news_content": "<p>Agritechnica 2023: DIN and ISO join forces to present standardization roadmap on smart farming<br /><br />Published on 10 November 2023<br /><br />Through the use of modern information and communication technologies, smart farming promises to boost productivity and efficiency in agriculture. For networking to function across the entire agrifood value chain, standards and specifications are key. They specify interfaces and uniform data formats and allow open access to new technologies.<br /><br />This is where international standards on smart farming come in, where ground-breaking work has been undertaken, in the form of a roadmap, to identify existing needs and the direction of standards development in the coming years for the agrifood sector.<br /><br />Together with ISO, the German Institute for Standardization (DIN) will be presenting this Roadmap on Smart Farming at Agritechnica – the world’s leading agricultural trade fair – in Hanover from 12 to 18 November 2023. The two organizations will be sharing a stand in Hall 15 (Stand J37) and showcasing the value of standards and specifications across the entire agrifood value chain.<br /><br />Standardization roadmap on smart farming<br /><br />This Roadmap was developed by the ISO Strategic Advisory Group (SAG) on Smart Farming, a group of ISO experts under the joint leadership of ANSI and DIN, the respective ISO members for the USA and Germany. As part of the work, 150 experts from 20 countries analysed the standardization landscape along the entire food value chain. Nine thematic areas were examined in relation to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): crop production, livestock, urban farming, terminology and semantics, social aspects, supply chains, original equipment manufacturers, climate adaptation, environment and data.<br /><br />The key part of the roadmap is the extensive recommendations for new standardization projects across the entire agricultural and food chains as well as structural recommendations for international cooperation. Development focuses on uniform agricultural semantics and fundamental requirements for data-driven systems in the agrifood sector. The primary emphasis is on standardizing agricultural data types, with the creation of a data type registry to facilitate the exchange of data. This creates a unified data reference architecture in the agrifood value chain.<br /><br />At the conclusion of the work on the Roadmap for Smart Farming, Christoph Winterhalter, DIN Executive Board Chairman and ISO Vice-President (Policy), said: “Standardization can help to harness the full potential of technology in agricultural and agrifood value creation. By considering not only agricultural production but also the upstream and downstream production and distribution of food, we can now, for the first time, provide a comprehensive and structured recommendation of necessary standardization needs and translate them into concrete projects.”<br /><br />Sergio Mujica, ISO Secretary-General, commented: “Cooperation among the various institutions and experts is key for the vast and constantly expanding field of smart farming. The ISO SAG on Smart Farming has made it possible for the first time to compile on an international level a standardization roadmap for the agrifood sector. We are looking forward to starting work within our new technical committee in early 2024 to bring these ideas to fruition.”<br /><br />International cooperation in smart farming<br /><br />ISO has created a new technical committee (ISO/TC 347) on data-driven agrifood systems, aiming to improve interoperability in the agricultural sector and to respond to the needs highlighted in the roadmap. All ISO national standards bodies can contribute to this work, which will start in April 2024.<br /><br />Talks on standardization at Agritechnica<br /><br />Interested parties can find out more about the results of the Standardization Roadmap and the topic of smart farming at Agritechnica on 15 and 17 November.<br /><br />15 November 2023 at 3:30 pm: In the exposition area for industry experts (System & Components), DIN and ANSI, the US standards institute, will be jointly presenting on stage the results of the ISO Strategy Advisory Group (SAG) and the new ISO/TC 347, Data-driven agrifood systems.<br /><br />17 November 2023 at 4:30 pm: DIN activities on smart farming will also be presented to the audience on one of the DLG technical stages. Joint discussions on how agriculture can contribute to making Europe climate neutral will also take place.<br /><br />About DIN<br /><br />DIN, the German Institute for Standardization, is the independent platform for standardization in Germany and worldwide. As a partner for industry, research and society as a whole, DIN plays a major role in supporting the marketability of innovative solutions through standardization – be it in topics around the digitization of business and society or in the context of research projects. More than 36 500 experts from industry, research, consumer protection and the public sector bring their expertise to work on standardization projects managed by DIN.<br /><br />About ISO<br /><br />ISO is an international organization with a membership of 169 national standards bodies. Through its global network, it facilitates the development of voluntary and market-relevant International Standards that support innovation, sustainability, and global trade.<br /><br />Source: <a target='_blank' href='https://www.iso.org/news/supporting-agrifood-systems</a></p>",

If not managed properly, energy needs for space cooling will triple by 2050, together with associated emissions.<br /><br />In short, the more we try to keep cool, the more we heat the planet. If current growth trends continue, cooling equipment represents 20 per cent of total electricity consumption today – and is expected to more than double by 2050.<br /><br />Energy guzzlers<br /><br />Today’s cooling systems, such as air-conditioners (ACs) and refrigerators, consume massive amount of energy and often use refrigerants that warm the planet.<br /><br />The latest UNEP report shows that by taking measures to reduce the power consumption of cooling equipment could lead to a reduction of at least 60 per cent off predicted 2050 sectoral emissions by 2050.<br /><br />「The cooling sector must grow to protect everyone from rising temperatures, maintain food quality and safety, keep vaccines stable and economies productive,」 said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP, who launched the report during a press conference at Expo City, where COP28 has been underway since last Thursday.<br /><br />「But this growth must not come at the cost of the energy transition and more intense climate impacts,」 she urged.<br /><br />Global Cooling pledge<br /><br />The report was released in support of the ‘Global Cooling Pledge’, a joint initiative between the United Arab Emirates as host of COP28 and the UNEP-led ‘Cool Coalition’.<br /><br />It outlines actions to take in passive cooling strategies -- such as insulation, natural shading, ventilation and reflective surfaces, higher energy efficiency standards and a rapid phase down of climate-warming hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants.<br /><br />Following the report’s recommendations could reduce the projected 2050 emissions from business-as-usual cooling by around 3.8 billion tons of CO2equivalent.<br /><br />This would:<br /><br />-Allow an additional 3.5 billion people to benefit from refrigerators, air conditioners or passive cooling by 2050:<br /><br />-Reduce electricity bills for end users by US$1 trillion in 2050, and by US$17 trillion cumulatively between 2022 – 2050;<br /><br />-Reduce peak power requirements by between 1.5 and 2 terawatts (TW) – almost double the EU’s total generation capacity today: and<br /><br />-Avoid power generation investments in the order of $4 to $5 trillion.<br /><br /><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20231207_02_en/3.png' style='width: 100%;' /></p><p><br /><br />Want to know more?

    "news_content": "<p>06/12/2023 - High energy prices triggered by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine prompted governments to reduce excise taxes during 2022, leading to lower tax levels in many countries, according to new OECD analysis.<br /><br />Revenue Statistics 2023 shows that the average tax-to-GDP ratio in the OECD fell by 0.15 percentage points (p.p.) in 2022, to 34.0%. This was only the third such decline since the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-09: the level fell by 0.6 p.p. in 2017 and by 0.1 p.p. in 2019.<br /><br />Revenues from excise taxes fell as a share of GDP in 2022 in 34 of the 36 countries for which preliminary data is available, declining in absolute terms in 21 of these. In some countries, notably in Europe, these declines were related to reductions in energy taxes as well as lower demand for energy products. Revenues from value-added tax (VAT) also declined as a share of GDP in 19 countries, in part due to policies to cushion consumers against high prices for energy and food.<br /><br />The decline in revenues from excise taxes in 2022 was partly offset by increases in revenues from corporate income taxes (CIT), which rose as a share of GDP in more than three-quarters of OECD countries amid higher corporate profits, especially in the energy and agricultural sectors. CIT revenues in Norway rose by 8.8% of GDP due to exceptional profits in the energy sector.<br /><br />Overall tax revenues declined as a share of GDP in 21 of the 36 countries in 2022, increased in 14 countries and remained at the same level in one. The largest decline was observed in Denmark (-5.5 p.p., to 41.9%) while the largest increases were seen in Korea (2.2 p.p., to 32.0%) and Norway (1.8 p.p., to 44.3%).</p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20231207_02_en/4.png' style='width: 100%;' /></p><p>The decline in the OECD’s average tax-to-GDP ratio followed two years of increases during the COVID-19 pandemic, of 0.15 p.p. in 2020 and 0.6 p.p. in 2021. Tax-to-GDP ratios in 2022 ranged from 16.9% in Mexico to 46.1% in France.<br /><br />A special feature in the new report examines the extent to which tax revenues in OECD countries have kept pace with economic growth in recent decades by analysing tax buoyancy for different tax types for the period from 1980 to 2021. The study finds that tax revenues typically increased at the same rate as GDP over this period; revenues from CIT were the most buoyant over the long run – increasing faster than economic growth – while revenues from excise taxes were the least buoyant, increasing at a slower rate than GDP.<br /><br />To access the Revenue Statistics report, data, overview and country notes, go to https://oe.cd/revenue-statistics.<br /><br />Media queries should be directed to Manal Corwin (+33 1 45 24 18 80), Director of the OECD Centre for Tax Policy and Administration (CTPA); David Bradbury (+33 1 45 24 15 97), Deputy Director of CTPA; Lawrence Speer (+33 1 45 24 79 70) or the OECD Media Office (+33 1 45 24 97 00).<br /><br />Working with over 100 countries, the OECD is a global policy forum that promotes policies to preserve individual liberty and improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.<br /><br />Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/global-energy-crisis-and-government-responses-drive-a-significant-fall-in-tax-levels-in-oecd-countries.htm'>https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/global-energy-crisis-and-government-responses-drive-a-significant-fall-in-tax-levels-in-oecd-countries.htm</a></p>",

This is a key finding of a new UN Environment Programme (UNEP) assessment of such new alternatives to animal agriculture, a sector accounting for up to a fifth of planet-warming emissions, with meat consumption slated to grow by 50 per cent by 2050.<br /><br />What’s cooking? An assessment of the potential impact of select novel alternatives to conventional animal products focuses on three types of alternatives: 1) Novel plant- based meats, 2) Cultivated meat from animal cells, and 3) Protein-rich products derived through rapid fermentation by microorganisms. It is part of UNEP’s Frontiers series, which identifies and draws attention to emerging issues of environmental concern.<br /><br />The report, produced with the support of the Government of Belgium, finds that these alternatives not only show significant potential for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but they can also contribute to reductions in land degradation and deforestation, water and soil pollution and loss of biodiversity, as well as to reducing the risks of zoonotic diseases and anti-microbial resistance. These novel alternatives could also help to significantly reduce animal welfare concerns, compared to their conventional counterparts.<br /><br />The authors conclude that novel alternatives can likely play a role in supporting a more sustainable, healthier and more humane food system, with regional differences. It reviews policies decision makers may consider to safeguard food security, jobs, livelihoods, social and gender equity, and culture to help maximize the beneficial outcomes of novel meat and dairy alternatives, while avoiding potential negative health and social impacts.<br /><br />”New food alternatives will offer a broader spectrum of consumer choices,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. ”Further, such alternatives can also lessen the pressures on agricultural lands and reduce emissions, thereby helping us address the triple planetary crisis - the crisis of climate change, the crisis of biodiversity and nature loss, the crisis of pollution and waste - as well as address the health and environmental consequences of the animal agriculture industry. More government support, as well as open and transparent research, can help unlock the potential of these new technologies for some countries.”<br /><br />While conventional animal products are an important source of protein for many communities, particularly in developing countries, in many high- and middle-income countries, their production and consumption happen at a scale that negatively impacts people and the planet. The tens of billions of animals slaughtered annually are far from the only victims of a fast-growing animal agriculture industry. Producing and consuming animal-source foods, while offering important nutrients, has also been associated with significant challenges for public health: excess levels of red and processed meats consumption is associated with cardiovascular diseases, certain cancers, obesity, and diabetes. Animal agriculture is also associated with increased risks of anti-microbial resistance – 73 per cent of all antimicrobials sold are used in animal agriculture – and with the spread of zoonotic diseases such as COVID-19 or Avian Influenza.<br /><br />The animal agriculture industry is a major driver of climate change: animal GHG emissions, feed production, changes in land use and energy-intensive global supply chains account for almost 60 per cent of food-related GHG emissions and 14-20 per cent of global GHG emissions.<br /><br />While novel alternative foods can reduce harm to farm animals and could contribute to improving public health, other health benefits aren’t as evident: some novel plant-based products tend to be highly processed and have high amounts of salt and saturated fats. Evidence on the health impacts of using cultured meat from animal cells or fermentation remains limited. By closely mimicking or replicating the sensory experiences of meat and other animal products, novel alternatives may help consumers, particularly in high- and middle-income countries, shift away from unsustainably high levels of animal protein consumption. However, cost, taste, and social and cultural acceptability will strongly affect the trajectory of nascent alternatives to conventional animal products.<br /><br />The report underlines the need to ensure a just transition through equitable and regionally appropriate approaches to food systems change. It reviews policy options to shift the food industry towards a healthier and more sustainable future: greater support for open access research and commercialization, shifting subsidies, tax rebates, direct financial investments, and loan guarantees to favor novel alternatives, as well as internationally agreed mechanisms on supportive trade policies and food safety standards.<br /><br />The authors underscore the need for open and transparent research to understand the nutritional implications of regular consumption of alternatives, and to understand the socio-economic implications of their uptake in different regions, including for equity, food security, and livelihoods of smallholder farmers.<br /><br />The report does not consider meat from wild animals, fish or other aquatic animals, though new technologies may also reshape the fishing sector. The report is not an assessment of other alternatives to the current food system: regenerative livestock farms, feed additives to reduce emissions from animal agriculture, farming insects, reduced meat consumption in favor of whole plant protein sources like beans, vegan products like tofu, or taxing meat. Such alternatives are already being pursued alongside the three alternatives examined in the report, but have struggled so far to win government support and achieve impacts at the desired scale or speed. <br /><br />NOTES TO EDITORS <br /><br />About the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)<br /><br />UNEP is the leading global voice on the environment.

The tool sets out how the disclosure requirements and datapoints in each set of standards relate to each other, emphasizing the high degree of commonality already achieved and laying down solid foundations to build a reciprocal digital taxonomy. Interoperability prevents the need for double reporting and results in a user-friendly reporting system without undue complexity. As a consequence, entities reporting under ESRS will be deemed reporting ‘with reference’ to the GRI standards and existing GRI reporters will be able to leverage their current reporting efforts to prepare their ESRS ‘Sustainability statement’.<p><ul><li>Further collaboration on standards and guidance development, including existing and new sector standards; proportionate reporting for SMEs in the EU; standards for non-EU companies for which the CSRD will apply.</li><li>Education and training for ESRS preparers and users, including steps to accredit GRI as an ESRS training organization, leveraging its education and professional certification programs.</li><li>Interoperability of digital XBRL taxonomies, with a simplified tagging system and digital correspondence table between both standards.</li></ul></p><p>With this new phase in their cooperation, and in line with the joint interoperability statement published in September 2023, both parties have decided to implement three common foundational principles:<br /><br />1. Companies benefit from preparing quality data from reporting publicly on their management efforts in relation to their positive and negative impacts.<br /><br />2. All stakeholders, including investors, will benefit from standardized, credible, and comparable information on impacts.<br /><br />3. Optimal interoperability between global and European sustainability reporting standards is in the interests of companies and other organizations to minimize the reporting burden.<br /><br />As a multistakeholder organization, tasked with the elaboration of sustainability reporting standards as technical advice to the European Commission, EFRAG welcomes the fruitful dialogue with other standard setting organisations or initiatives. Our relationship with GRI has been and is exemplary in that regard and we look forward to this second phase in our technical cooperation.<br />-Hans Buysse, President of EFRAG Administrative Board<br /><br />The partnership between GRI and EFRAG has already borne fruit by ensuring that the new EU standards and the GRI Standards – which many companies in Europe and beyond are using to report their impacts — are closely aligned. Encompassing practical resources and training alongside deeper engagement on standards, this new MoU reassures companies and all stakeholders of our joint commitment to an aligned, efficient, and feasible EU and global ecosystem for impact reporting. I look forward to continued collaboration with our European partners to achieve this aim.<br />-Eelco van der Enden, CEO of GRI<br /><br />The interoperability index is an important deliverable of our collaboration as it will enable GRI reporters to substantiate the high degree of alignment between GRI and ESRS standards in relation to impacts. Building on our technical collaboration over the past two years, we welcome this new agreement.<br />-Carol Adams, Chair of the GRI Global Sustainability Standards Board (GSSB)<br /><br />Interoperability is at the heart of the EU approach. From the beginning and going forward EFRAG strives to build on and contribute to the global progress of quality sustainability reporting as well as to minimise the reporting burden for companies. With the recently adopted ESRS, companies will be able to prepare their sustainability statement in an interoperable ecosystem and this is good news. We welcome the high level of commonality illustrated by our joint Interoperability Index since reporting on impacts is foundational under the European double materiality approach.<br /><br />-Patrick de Cambourg, Chair of EFRAG Sustainability Reporting Board<br /><br />Under the first EFRAG-GRI MoU (signed on 8 July 2021) the two parties agreed to share expertise to co-construct the ESRS and contribute to global convergence, joining each other’s technical expert groups and aligning standard-setting activities. This collaboration achieved a high level of interoperability between the ESRS and GRI Standards. This new MoU (signed on 30 November 2023) is a step further in terms of technical cooperation and collaboration with EFRAG, the European Standard-setter.<br /><br />Source: <a target='_blank' href='https://www.globalreporting.org/news/news-center/efrag-and-gri-enhance-collaboration-with-deeper-ties/'>https://www.globalreporting.org/news/news-center/efrag-and-gri-enhance-collaboration-with-deeper-ties/</a></p>",

But ISO standards can help us make the right policies and speed up the pace. </p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20240101_m_en/1.jpeg' style='width: 100%;' /></p><p>Published on 11 December 2023<br /><br />Zakiah Kassam<br /><br />President, AirVironment Canada Inc., and Chair-elect, ISO/TC 207, Environmental management<br /><br />World War II made an indelible mark on the world. As fighting ceased in 1945, the world was in dire need of rebuilding and reformation at an unprecedented scale. ISO was one of the key global organizations to rise from the ashes to do exactly that. Today, it can once again help the world reform to address another existential threat: climate change. <br /><br />As policymakers gather in Dubai to discuss how to accelerate climate action, a good place to start is with the reminder that standards are a powerful tool.<br /><br />Standards provide us with the assurance that change is both real and meaningful. They ensure results and help cut through any potential greenwashing. They also make change happen at speed. Enacting laws and implementing policies for climate action can take years – and we don’t have years. Using standards can get us there faster, by reducing the time it takes to design and implement government policies.<br /><br />COP28 is a key checkpoint on the global climate trajectory. As a united front, we need to act together in three key areas: the curbing of emissions, risk planning and financing. Standards are our most effective tool in driving action on all three.<br /><br />Standards can supercharge our climate efforts<br /><br />It is paramount that organizations clearly report on their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and their progress on reducing them. Standards are helping to guide the development of greenhouse gas inventories, which comprehensively list GHG volumes and where they come from. As such, they are an effective tool as we work to curb emissions, because they demand verifiable evidence. This bolsters trust that climate action is action and not just rhetoric.<br /><br />This trust also allows the world to break the limits of convention when it comes to risk planning. This is important because climate change risks differ from other risks. Conventional approaches that use statistical probabilities may not be effective, and climate change impacts can have a chain of knock-on effects. ISO standards detail best-practice approaches for undertaking climate change risk and vulnerability assessments. <br /><br />Local governments and communities facing climate change impacts need plans for adaptation, but may not always have the resources to deliver or update them. ISO standards provide a policy planning roadmap. They demonstrate how to partner the right business units with the right stakeholders to tackle key risks and set out priorities. ISO standards can also help to guide meaningful reporting and communication on adaptation.<br /><br />But risk isn’t the only barrier. A lack of material resources is a challenge, and financing is a major hurdle. Standards can help here, too.<br /><br />More than USD 4.2 trillion of clean energy investment is required in 2030 to get us to net-zero emissions. Governments are expected to finance approximately 30 % of that through a combination of low-cost loans, grants and cheap financing.<br /><br />A key challenge for governments setting up support for green energy programmes is the risk of spending taxpayer’s cash and not getting the desired results. Nothing dents public confidence like wasted money.<br /><br />ISO provides a ready-to-implement structure that helps governments to define their criteria for eligible projects and establish performance metrics. The ISO green debt instruments series of standards (ISO 14030), for example, specifies requirements to ensure the integrity of green bonds and loans, includes a taxonomy for eligible projects, and sets out requirements for a verification programme.<br /><br />When it comes to the complexities of grants to support climate resilience initiatives, ISO also has a best-practice standard that can help governments design a grant mechanism quickly and effectively. ISO 14093, the ISO standard relating to performance-based climate resilience grants, is based on the United Nations Capital Development Fund’s local climate adaptive living (LoCAL) mechanism. This ISO standard provides guidance on how to design a national system for local adaptation financing and includes minimum conditions to ensure financial safeguards and a menu of eligible adaptation investments that can promote climate resilience.<br /><br />The power of ISO and public partners<br /><br />Public agencies wield substantial influence over markets thanks to their sizable project procurement budgets. Harnessing this influence strategically has the power to shape industry behaviour. Public agencies can incorporate contractual requirements that build on ISO standards and the ISO conformity assessment system.<br /><br />Integrating ISO standards can help in setting procurement rules for purchasing goods and services in a way that advances climate action. Any policymaker wanting to drive positive change quickly needs to begin by thinking of standards.<br /><br />Because without standards, there can be no improvement.<br /><br />About Zakiah Kassam<br /><br />Zakiah Kassam is Chair of the ISO technical committee on environmental management for the 2024-2026 term and a member of the Governing Council of the Standards Council of Canada (SCC).

The aim of the <a target='_blank' href='https://ghgprotocol.org/ghg-protocol-standards-and-guidance-update-process-0'>current corporate standards update process</a> is to align with best practice approaches to ensure GHG Protocol standards for scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 are effective in providing a rigorous and credible accounting foundation for businesses to measure, plan and track progress toward science-based and net-zero targets in line with the Paris Agreement and to keep the 1.5°C goal in reach. Any future updates will seek harmonization and alignment with accounting rules under development through major disclosure initiatives and coordination with other key programs and initiatives.<br /><br />As part of the standards update process, GHG Protocol will examine how organizations account for and report efforts to mitigate their climate impacts, including the roles of <a target='_blank' href='https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/Market-based%20accounting%20Survey%20Memo.pdf'>market-based accounting approaches</a> and/or <a target='_blank' href='https://ghgprotocol.org/project-protocol'>project accounting methods</a> (i.e., quantification of reduced or avoided emissions compared to a baseline scenario, building on existing standards and guidance). GHG Protocol plans to provide guidance addressing the role of such methods in GHG emissions reporting and/or target setting. Guidance is expected to highlight the role of programs and policymakers in defining target setting and programmatic rules, for example, related to eligibility of market instruments.<br /><br />In a dedicated survey and proposals process, GHG Protocol received nearly 350 responses and over two dozen proposals for market-based and/or project accounting approaches. Feedback was provided across a variety of different sectors, including natural gas/biomethane, aviation fuels (SAF), agricultural commodities, freight transport, maritime shipping, steel, aluminum, and others. Such proposals have typically arisen in cases where companies purchase products or commodities from common pools or distribution systems and when direct contracting with suppliers or identifying individual points of origin are difficult or infeasible. <br /><br />In October, GHG Protocol hosted a webinar highlighting topline findings from the stakeholder feedback on the market-based accounting approaches survey, which can be <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqgQcMvZwjw'>viewed here</a>. A written summary of the findings is forthcoming and will be input into the workplan beginning in early 2024.<br /><br />Get Involved<br /><br />GHG Protocol follows a multistakeholder standards development process. In November 2023, Greenhouse Gas Protocol launched a new governance structure, which includes a <a target='_blank' href='https://ghgprotocol.org/blog/announcement-ghg-protocol-launches-new-governance-call-steering-committee-and-independent'>Steering Committee, Independent Standards Board</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://ghgprotocol.org/blog/announcement-ghg-protocol-launches-call-expression-interest-technical-working-group'>Technical Working Groups</a>.

Some 180 Palestinian women are giving birth daily amidst this chaos.  People are facing the highest levels of food insecurity ever recorded. Famine is around the corner”, he said.<br /><br />But rocket attacks from militants are still raining down on Israel, while more than 120 people are still held hostage in Gaza, he added.<br /><br />With tensions in the West Bank at boiling point, and “the spectre of further regional spillover of the war” looming, Mr. Griffiths said that the war must end, “not just for the people of Gaza and its threatened neighbours, but for the generations to come who will never forget these 90 days of hell and of assaults on the most basic precepts of humanity.”<br /><br />He concluded with a call for the international community to use all influence possible to end the fighting, meet civilians’ essential needs, and secure the release of all hostages.<br /><br />COVID infections rising fast and under-reported, warns WHO<br /><br />The UN health agency WHO confirmed on Friday that coronavirus numbers are spiking globally and that we “should expect more cases” in the coming winter months in the northern hemisphere.<br /><br />Latest data from the World Health Organization covering the four weeks to 17 December indicated a 52 per cent increase in infections compared with the previous 28-days.<br /><br />That amounts to 850,000 new COVID-19 cases reported, but the true figure is likely much higher, according to WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier:<br /><br />“You know that all throughout the world and you've seen it in many of your own countries, the reporting has dropped, the surveillance centers have dropped, the vaccination centers have dropped, have been dismantled as well or shut down”, he told reporters in Geneva.<br /><br />“This, of course, leads to an incomplete picture and we should expect unfortunately more cases than we have officially reported.”<br /><br />Most infections have been caused by a new COVID strain called JN.1 which is now under close scrutiny by the UN health agency as a “variant of interest”. JN.1 was reportedly first detected in the United States before spreading across dozens of countries.<br /><br />It evolved from the Omicron variant which was linked to a peak in COVID infections in 2022.<br /><br />Food price inflation fears ease again: FAO<br /><br />The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported on Friday that the Food Price Index ended the year just over 10 per cent below its December 2022 level, further easing concerns over food price inflation worldwide.<br /><br />The monthly figure for a basket of traded food commodities was also down around 1.5 per cent for December, averaging 118.5 points, compared with the previous month.<br /><br />The sharpest drop came in international sugar quotations, which were some 16.6 per cent down for December on the previous month.<br /><br />For 2023, the index was 13.7 percent lower overall than the average value for 2022, with only the international sugar price index higher over the year.<br /><br />FAO said the sugar price drop was mainly due to the strong pace of production in Brazil along with reduced use of sugarcane for ethanol production in India.<br /><br />The cereal price index rose 1.5 per cent in December, with wheat, maize, rice and parley all rising due to shipment limitations experienced by exporters. Cereal prices for the year however we more than 15 per cent below the 2022 average.<br /><br /></p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20240111_m_en/3.png' style='width: 100%;' /></p><p>Source: <a target='_blank' href='https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/01/1145327'>https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/01/1145327</a></p>",

In Denmark, Estonia, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden, the normal retirement age will rise to 70 years or more if life-expectancy gains materialise as projected and legislated links with life expectancy are applied.<br /><br />The labour force participation of older workers has increased sharply across the OECD, with the employment rate of 55-to-64 year olds in the OECD reaching a record 64% in the second quarter of 2023, almost 8 percentage points higher than a decade ago. However, many older workers still struggle to keep their skills up to date, have limited access to good-quality jobs, and risk having an inadequate pension in old age because of short and unstable working careers.<br /><br />“Pensions at a Glance provides comparative data and analysis on pension systems and reforms across the OECD to help countries ensure our pension systems remain a secure, sustainable, effective and fair source of retirement income. Pension reform alone cannot fully address the impact of population ageing and longer life expectancies on pension system sustainability,” OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said. “By providing targeted support for training and ensuring healthy working conditions, countries can improve the employment prospects of older workers. This will help ensure that pension systems remain financially sustainable, while delivering decent incomes in retirement.”<br /><br />This edition of Pensions at a Glance assesses the impact of special pension policies in OECD countries for workers in hazardous and arduous jobs, including those granting access to early retirement through occupation-specific schemes or special rules within a general pension scheme.<br /><br />Prevention of health problems and reskilling to move workers out of arduous work before health deteriorates significantly is key. Support for people with work-related health problems should be provided primarily through work injury, sickness and disability insurance rather than special old-age pension schemes for hazardous or arduous work. Improving the regulation of work-time and workplace safety and a strengthened role for labour inspection bodies and occupational health services would also help.<br /><br />For further information, journalists are invited to contact Monika Queisser (tel. + 33 1 45 24 96 34) or Hervé Boulhol (+ 33 1 45 24 84 58) of the OECD Directorate of Employment, Labour and Social Affairs.<br /><br />Working with over 100 countries, the OECD is a global policy forum that promotes policies to preserve individual liberty and improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.<br /><br />Source: <a target='_blank' href='https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/improving-opportunities-and-working-conditions-for-older-workers-can-bolster-pension-system-sustainability-and-address-labour-market-shortages.htm'>https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/improving-opportunities-and-working-conditions-for-older-workers-can-bolster-pension-system-sustainability-and-address-labour-market-shortages.htm</a></p>",

    "news_summary": "",
    "image_path": "",
    "news_content": "<p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20240129_m_en/2.jpg' style='width: 100%;' /></p><p>24 JAN 2024 / STORY / CHEMICALS & POLLUTION ACTION<br /><br />AFor months last year, Florida’s beachgoers were plagued by rotting tangles of decaying seaweed that had washed ashore. Known technically as sargassum, the thick clumps were part of a record-setting 8,000-kilometre-long seaweed belt in the Atlantic Ocean.<br /><br />ASargassum blooms cause a range of environmental problems, including coastal “dead zones” bereft of aquatic life. Past sargassum outbreaks have been linked to the excessive release of phosphorus and other chemical substances known as nutrients.<br /><br />APhosphorus and another nutrient, nitrogen, are key ingredients in synthetic fertilizers. They have become increasingly popular in recent decades but can have devastating effects when they enter lakes, rivers and the ocean.<br /><br />AAt the upcoming sixth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-6), the world’s top decision-making body on the environment, delegates from UN Member States are expected to discuss how to advance global cooperation around nutrients. In particular, they are slated to explore ways to rein in excess phosphorus in the environment without compromising efforts to end hunger. This builds on work already done by Member States through past UNEA resolutions to decrease nitrogen pollution.<br /><br />A“Reducing nutrient pollution and recovering nutrients, such as phosphorus, for reuse is a win-win both for the environment and human health,” says Leticia Carvalho, head of the Marine and Freshwater Branch at the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). “But to succeed, we need governments, scientists, the private sector and civil society to come together.“<br /><br />Ahead of UNEA-6 discussions, here are some facts about phosphorus use and how the mineral can be better managed.<br /><br />What is phosphorus and what are its main uses today?<br /><br />Discovered more than 350 years ago, phosphorus is an indispensable nutrient that helps plants to grow. Its primary use is in manufacturing synthetic fertilizer to increase crop yields, making it crucial to food security. Phosphorus is a key ingredient in animal feed and is also used to produce steel, food additives, electric car batteries, certain pesticides and household cleaning products.<br /><br />Where does phosphorus come from?<br /><br />Phosphate rock is the main source of easily accessible phosphorus for manufacturing synthetic fertilizer and has been produced in large quantities since World War II.<br /><br />So, phosphorus reserves are limited?<br /><br />Yes. The amount of phosphorus in the world is finite and there is a need to reduce how much of the mineral we are extracting. This can be done by making phosphorus mining and processing more efficient. Also important: optimizing how phosphorus is used in agriculture and recovering phosphorus from waste.<br /><br />Where does phosphorus pollution come from?<br /><br />Agriculture is a major source of phosphorus pollution, both from the production of crops and raising of livestock. Phosphorus is also lost through sewage, food that is thrown away and other waste streams.<br /><br />Why is too much phosphorus a bad thing?<br /><br />Excess phosphorus, like the other key nutrient, nitrogen, depletes soils of their richness. It also pollutes lakes, rivers and the ocean in a process known as eutrophication. This leads to algal blooms which contaminate supplies of drinking water and create oxygen-starved dead zones, which can kill fish and other aquatic species. Phosphorus pollution is a prime driver of biodiversity loss and contributes to the degradation of ecosystems on which humanity depends. Eutrophication is estimated to cost the US economy alone US$2.2 billion annually.<br /><br />Is the rate of phosphorus pollution increasing?<br /><br />Yes. Globally, phosphorus losses from land to fresh waters have doubled in the last century and continue to increase. Despite large-scale efforts to reduce nutrient pollution, Carvalho said the release of phosphorus is already overwhelming the planet’s ability to cope. As much as 80 per cent of the mineral is lost or wasted during use. Along with the environmental fallout, that costs farmers, factory owners and others about US$265 billion a year.<br /><br />“We’ve long since crossed the red line on phosphorus pollution and the effects on the Earth have been devastating,” says Carvalho. “If humanity continues down this path, we risk compromising countless ecosystems around the world.“<br /><br />Does that mean humanity should just stop using phosphorus?<br /><br />No. The key is for phosphorus to be used more sustainably and to prevent excessive amounts of it from seeping into the environment. There is a common misconception that the more phosphorus-based fertilizer used, the more crop yields will rise. This is not necessarily true. The key is to use the right amount, so that crops will still thrive and the environment will not suffer unduly.<br /><br />How can humanity more sustainably use phosphorus?<br /><br />Changes in agricultural practices can help reduce phosphorus pollution. The use of manure, for example, can lessen the need for phosphorus-based fertilizers. Farmers can also plant cover crops and avoid tilling the soil, which will improve soil health and reduce the need for fertilizer. These practices should be part of a larger shift towards regenerative agriculture, a more planet-friendly approach to farming that improves soil health and maintains biodiversity.<br /><br />As well, synthetic fertilizers should only be used at the stage when crops need phosphorus the most. The livestock sector must also explore ways of recovering phosphorus from manure.<br /><br />Finally, wastewater discharges some 3 millions tonnes of phosphorus into the environment every year globally. Proper treatment could reduce the concentration of phosphorus and nitrogen in wastewater by at least 80 per cent.<br /><br />The solutions will require innovation—not just in technology but also in ways of working.  It will require cooperation within and across sectors that may not have traditionally worked together.<br /><br />How much do we need to reduce phosphorus pollution by?<br /><br />A lot. The Our Phosphorus Future report calls for a 50 per cent reduction in global phosphorus pollution, coupled with a 50 per cent increase in the recycling of phosphorus lost in residues and wastewater by 2050. The report said that would bolster food security and improve water quality, among a host of other benefits.<br /><br />What is UNEP doing to tackle phosphorus pollution?<br /><br />UNEP hosts the Global Partnership on Nutrient Management, launched in 2009. It promotes effective nutrient management, particularly of nitrogen and phosphorus, to both achieve food security and protect the environment.<br /><br />UNEP’s efforts to control the environmental fallout of phosphorus come amid a wider global effort to rein in pollution, which received a boost last year with the landmark Global Framework on Chemicals. Based around 28 targets, the framework sets out a roadmap for protecting people and the planet from harmful chemicals and waste. UNEP will manage a trust fund that will help implement the agreement.<br /><br />As the leading global authority on the environment, UNEP is also helping countries implement the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, including Target 7, which addresses phosphorus. The framework calls for a 50 per cent reduction in excess nutrients lost to the environment by 2030 and for the risk from pesticides to be reduced by at least half.<br /><br />The sixth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-6) will be held from 26 February to 1 March 2024 at the UNEP headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, under the theme: Effective, inclusive and sustainable multilateral actions to tackle climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. Through its resolutions and calls to action, the Assembly provides leadership and catalyzes intergovernmental action on the environment.</p><br /><br /><p>Source: <a target='_blank' href='https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/what-phosphorus-and-why-are-concerns-mounting-about-its-environmental-impact'>https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/what-phosphorus-and-why-are-concerns-mounting-about-its-environmental-impact</a></p>",

At the same time transits through the Panama Canal have plummeted 49 per cent compared to its peak, due to dwindling water levels as a result of a severe, climate-change-induced drought.<br /><br />A vital artery connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the Panama Canal is particularly important for the trade between countries on the west coast of South America, and for links between Asia and the western United States.<br /><br />Vulnerable populations, especially in landlocked and developing countries could bear the brunt of the impact on the two key trade routes, potentially increasing their living costs and reducing access to essential items.<br /><br />Environmental cost<br /><br />Ships avoiding the Suez and the Panama Canals and seeking alternative routes, translating into longer cargo travel distances, rising costs and insurance premiums, and increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.<br /><br />For more than a decade, the shipping industry had adopted reduced speeds to lower fuel costs and their carbon footprint, according to UNCTAD.<br /><br />However, due to the interplay of conflict and climate shocks, ships have been authorized to speed up - leading to higher fuel consumption and emissions.<br /><br />For instance, a Singapore-Rotterdam (Netherlands) round trip avoiding the Suez Canal/Red Sea route could result in up to 70 per cent increase in GHG emissions.<br /><br />Far-reaching implications<br /><br />UNCTAD underscored the potential far-reaching economic implications of prolonged disruptions in container shipping, threatening global supply chains and potentially delaying deliveries, causing higher costs and inflation.<br /><br />Energy prices are surging as gas transits are discontinued, directly impacting energy supplies and prices, especially in Europe.<br /><br />Global food prices are also expected to take a major hit due to higher freight costs.<br /><br />“Disruptions in grain shipments from Europe, Russia, and Ukraine pose risks to global food security, affecting consumers and lowering prices paid to producers,” UNCTAD warned.<br /><br />Shifting patterns<br /><br />The UNCTAD study also noted a shift in transport patterns, such as in the United States, where demand for rail transport services between the coasts has surged in recent weeks.<br /><br />Major Pacific ports such as Los Angeles and Long Beach in west are now using rail routes vs. more costly and unreliable sea routes.<br /><br />Major changes are afoot in the trading of commodities too. For example, grain shipments to Egypt are being sourced from Brazil or the US instead of Ukraine, while Russian oil shipments have becoming increasingly focused on India and China instead of Europe.<br /><br /></p><p>Source: <a target='_blank' href='https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/02/1146862'>https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/02/1146862</a></p>",

There was little change in exports and imports compared to Q3 2023, as a robust recovery in East Asia was counterbalanced by a slowdown in Europe and North America. Export growth stagnated in the United States, with lower sales of automobiles being offset by higher sales of industrial supplies. In the European Union, exports were down by 0.6% driven by a decline in chemical products, while imports were down by 1.8%. Conversely, merchandise trade growth was strong in East Asia. China recorded a 0.6% increase in exports, in part driven by high tech products such as mobile phones, and a 3.9% increase in imports due to mechanical and electrical products. Exports increased in Japan and surged in Korea due to strong automobile sales and a recovery of the Korean semiconductor business. Higher sales of primary commodities fuelled export growth in Australia, Indonesia, and Brazil.<br /><br />On the services side, preliminary estimates[1] point to moderate growth for the G20 in Q4 2023 compared to the previous quarter, as measured in current US dollars (Figure 1 and 2). Exports and imports are estimated to have grown by 1.6% and 1.3% in Q4 2023, respectively, following the 0.9% decrease in exports and 0.2% increase in imports in Q3. Exports rose by 2.5% in the United States reflecting higher receipts from most services, while imports expanded by 2.0% due to higher travel and transport expenditures. In Germany, exports grew by 1.6%, reflecting higher revenues from business and computer services, and imports rose by 2.0%, in part driven by higher travel expenditure abroad. Conversely, services exports fell markedly in France (minus 3.8%) and the United Kingdom (minus 6.2%), with imports also decreasing moderately in both countries. Soaring receipts for intellectual property services boosted export growth in Japan. Services exports also rose markedly in Korea and China, reflecting a widespread recovery across most service categories.<br /><br />G20 merchandise trade contracted in value terms in 2023 as a whole, with exports and imports decreasing by 3.3% and 5.5%, respectively. Conversely, preliminary estimates suggest that G20 services trade continued to expand in 2023, with export and import growing at around 7.3% and 10.5% respectively.</p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20240308_m_en/2.png' style='width: 100%;' /></p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20240308_m_en/3.png' style='width: 100%;' /></p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20240308_m_en/4.png' style='width: 100%;' /></p><p>The Q4 2023 trade in services values are preliminary estimates based on available data, covering at least 60% of exports and imports for the G20 aggregate which does not include African Union countries, except for South Africa.</p><p>Next publication date: 28 May 2024 - <a target='_blank' href='https://www.oecd.org/sdd/its/releasedatesoftheoecdnewsreleaseoninternationaltradestatistics.htm'>Release dates</a><br/><br/>Contacts: for further information, journalists are invited to contact the <a target='_blank' href='mailto:news.contact@oecd.org'>OECD's Media Relations Division</a> on (33) 1 45 24 97 00 or others should contact the<a target='_blank' href='mailto:stat.contact@oecd.org'> Statistics and Data Directorate.</a><br /><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://www.oecd.org/sdd/its/publicationsdocuments/newsrelease/'>Link to previous news releases</a><br /><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://www.oecd.org/sdd/its/'>Click for more information on trade statistics.</a></p><p><br /><br /></p><p>Source: <a target='_blank' href='https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/international-trade-statistics-trends-in-fourth-quarter-2023.htm'>https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/international-trade-statistics-trends-in-fourth-quarter-2023.htm</a></p>",

The course delves into the following topics:<br /><br />1. The ‘what’ and ‘why’ of external sustainability reporting assurance<br /><br />2. How to prepare organizations for external assurance<br /><br />3. Understanding the assurance process<br /><br />4. Finding the right assurance provider<br /><br />According to recent research by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), information disclosed using the GRI Standards is subject to assurance more often than that of any other reporting framework – with a 40% assurance rate. Nevertheless, more progress is needed for assurance to become a widespread practice in the sustainability reporting landscape.<br /><br />Given that auditing of ESG data is on the rise, it’s key for sustainability professionals to better understand how to put into practice assurance processes. That´s why this new training highlights the strategic significance of sustainability reporting assurance, aligning with global standards, and offering insights for participants to navigate this evolving landscape with confidence through a comprehensive and internationally applicable learning experience.<br /><br />A feature of the course is that it emphasizes the necessary considerations involved in appointing an external assurance provider, offering guidelines tailored to assist organizations in matching their specific needs with the expertise and capabilities of potential providers.<br /><br />The course takes around two hours to complete and is available online and on demand.<br /><br />You can access more short online courses on the GRI Academy to stay up-to-date with the latest trends, news and developments in sustainability reporting and the GRI Standards.</p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.globalreporting.org/news/news-center/understanding-the-importance-of-assurance-in-sustainability-reporting/'>https://www.globalreporting.org/news/news-center/understanding-the-importance-of-assurance-in-sustainability-reporting/</a></p>",

    "news_content": "<p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20240322_m_en/2.png' style='width: 100%;' /></p><p>Published: 8 Mar 2024<br />Type: News</p><p>Paris, 8 March 2024 - The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) is proud to announce the official launch of the Built Environment Market Transformation Action Agenda during the first Buildings and Climate Global Forum held in Paris.<br /><br />The Market Transformation Action Agenda brings together built environment stakeholders from all along the value chain to overcome the key barriers preventing us from achieving a net zero built environment. It acknowledges that the scale of change industry needs is only possible with deep and radical collaboration, in order to achieve our climate goals of halving emissions by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050.<br /><br />The Action Agenda, co-created by several hundred representations from over 100 companies and organizations, builds on the foundational principles of the Market Transformation Levers for a Net Zero Built Environment, developed by the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (GlobalABC) – to adopt life-cycle thinking and Whole Life Carbon assessment across the full value chain, to integrate carbon costs in decision-making and to transform supply and demand dynamics.<br /><br />The holistic and performance-based approach underlying these three market transformation levers represents an opportunity for all stakeholders to innovate and scale solutions along the value chain, adapted to their context and environment and ultimately leading to transformative change for all.<br /><br />During the Global Engagement Plenary on 8 March 2024, Dame Jo da Silva, Global Director of Sustainable Development at Arup, formally presented the Market Transformation Action Agenda on behalf of WBCSD to an audience of 1’000 participants from governments, industry, finance, cities and organizations representing over 70 countries.<br /><br />Benoit Bazin, CEO of Saint-Gobain, a leading global building material manufacturer, then presented the key messages from the Global Forum’s CEO Roundtable held the day before. He stressed the strong commitment and alignment of the industry to solve the major challenges that our planet is facing, and he underlined the unprecedented collaboration he is seeing across the entire value chain, evidenced in the Market Transformation Action Agenda.<br /><br />On behalf of the assembled business leaders, Benoit Bazin welcomed the Ministerial Chaillot Declaration being announced on the day, endorsed by 70 governments, and he reiterated that the business community is ready to support it.<br /><br />The Buildings and Climate Global Forum also saw the official presentation of the Buildings Breakthrough international priority actions for 2024-25. The Buildings Breakthrough aims to achieve “near-zero emissions and resilient buildings to be the new normal by 2030“. It supports accelerating decarbonization and enhancing resilience in the sector through international collaboration. Given the sector’s fragmented nature, a coordinated response from national governments is essential to steer the direction and pace of the transformation.<br /><br />The Market Transformation Action Agenda and the Buildings Breakthrough strongly support each other in the implementation of actions so that the collaboration encompasses private sector and public sector stakeholders who drive progress towards a common goal.<br /><br />All the recordings and proceedings of the Buildings and Climate Global Forum will be published shortly on the Global Forum website.<br /><br />“We call on all stakeholders to join the Market Transformation Action Agenda because it’s not just about buildings; it’s about transforming our world. If we’re going to decarbonize, if we’re going to create resilience, if we’re going to create a world that’s fit for the future, we have to do it together.” Peter Bakker, President and CEO, WBCSD.<br /><br />“The Market Transformation Agenda is extremely useful as it brings structure to the vast challenge to decarbonise the built environment. There are already many initiatives and lots of good work is happening across the industry. However, radical mission-led collaboration and transparency are key to identifying scalable solutions and accelerate progress. To achieve this, ULI C Change is pleased to be working with WCBSD on the Market Transformation Action Agenda as it aligns with our approach to mobilise our members and the wider industry to identify and propose actionable solutions for key barriers to decarbonisation.” Lisette van Doorn, CEO Europe, Urban Land Institute.<br /><br />“What I like about the Market Transformation Action Agenda is that it proposes very concrete actions, over the coming 3 years, to achieve our long-term goals of decarbonizing the built environment. RICS will continue to pro-actively support this initiative, taking a leading role within the first lever, which focuses on consistency, transparency and data availability. Our Whole Carbon Assessment standard, published end 2023, provides a way to consistently measure both embodied and operational carbon. We look forward to working together with other key stakeholders to develop a set of common global principles that will enable consistent and transparent measurement of carbon.” Justin Young, CEO RICS.<br /><br />For more information, please contact Roland Hunziker, Director Built Environment, WBCSD<br /><br />Tags: Pathways | Built Environment</p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/News-Insights/General/News/WBCSD-unveils-Built-Environment-Market-Transformation-Action-Agenda-during-Buildings-and-Climate-Global-Forum'>https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/News-Insights/General/News/WBCSD-unveils-Built-Environment-Market-Transformation-Action-Agenda-during-Buildings-and-Climate-Global-Forum</a></p>",

    "news_content": "<p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20240409_m_en/1.png' style='width: 100%;' /></p><p>Published: 26 Mar 2024<br /><br />Type: News<br /><br />London, 26 March 2024 - The agrifood sector must play a crucial role in keeping 1.5C within reach by urgently cutting greenhouse gas emissions and scaling up nature protection solutions through their value chains, according to a series of reports launching today from the Food and Land Use Coalition, WBCSD and We Mean Business Coalition. <br /><br /></p><p>The Future Fit Food and Agriculture report series argues for the adoption of ambitious action plans by agrifood companies and sector-wide investments of up to USD $205 billion per year between 2025 and 2030 to unlock up to 9 gigatons of CO2 equivalent of mitigation annually by 2030. The first report aims to help agrifood companies understand the implications of current and emerging voluntary standards and the expected trajectory of regulation for climate and nature. The second report unpacks the financial costs and benefits of implementing mitigation solutions to tackle agriculture and land-use change emissions in company value chains.<br /><br />The case for urgent action is clear: agricultural production emissions must decrease ~30% by 2030 to align with the Paris Agreement’s goal to limit global warming to 1.5°C by 2050.<br /><br />The climate strategies of most food and agriculture companies, from input providers and food producers, through to traders and multinational companies, are not comprehensive or ambitious enough. According to the World Benchmarking Alliance, of the 350 most influential food and agriculture companies, only about half have so far disclosed Scope 3 commitments.<br /><br />In light of these challenges, policymakers are increasingly mandating action on climate and nature from companies, using voluntary standards as the basis for new sustainability legislation.<br /><br />Morgan Gillespy, Executive Director, Food and Land Use Coalition, commented: ‘Food and agriculture companies are facing a choice. Those striving to deliver ambitious sustainability strategies today, in close collaboration with farmers in their supply chain, will likely enjoy lower costs, stronger returns and greater agility in the face of advancing sustainability regulation. Those that stall won’t just fail to deliver on climate and nature commitments, they will face higher costs and higher supply chain risks in the long term.’<br /><br />Agricultural production and land-use change emissions in company value chains account for nearly half of total food systems emissions (an estimated 10 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent of a total 21 GtCO2e in 2030).<br /><br />Analysis from the Future Fit Food and Agriculture reports series estimates that, to mitigate up to 90% of their annual agricultural and land-use change emissions by 2030, food and agriculture companies should expect sector-wide costs of approximately USD $205 billion per year (2025-2030).<br /><br />While significant, such investments are manageable for the sector as a whole and have associated co-benefits:<br /><br /><p><ul><li>USD $205billion per year represents less than 2% of the sector’s projected USD $13 trillion average annual revenues for 2025-2030.</li><li>One-fifth of the USD $205 billion per year are investments in new and growing markets. These investments, estimated to be USD $40 billion per year (average annual from 2025-2030), could lead to potential additional returns of up to USD $190 billion per year by 2030.</li><li>Some on-farm solutions provide savings and/or increased yields worth up to USD $30 billion per year.</li><li>Other associated co-benefits include increased supply-chain resilience and delivery on other sustainability commitments, such as nature targets;</li></ul></p><p>The burden of implementing mitigation solutions should be shared equitably across value chains. In general, the more upstream a value chain participant is, the lower its margins tend to be -- farmers in particular tend to have the lowest margins of any value chain participants. It follows that companies across the value chain must work together to determine transition economics and arrive at a transparent, fair and equitable distribution of costs and benefits. They also stand to benefit from making more unified policy asks to government on what it can do to alleviate the costs for all and enable acceleration.<br /><br />The second Future Fit Food and Agriculture report shows that the costs for mitigation, as a percentage of revenues, change very significantly depending on where actors sit along the value chain. The report shares three examples to illustrate this point, including the case of a Brazilian beef farmer, for whom mitigating 30% of their Scope 1 emissions could cost as much as 17% of their revenues - an unrealistic expectation given farmers typically achieve profit margins of less than 20%.<br /><br />Overcoming inequity requires food and agriculture companies to reassess how they partner with other actors in the value chain, particularly farmers, and how they engage with policymakers to incentivize and accelerate action.  Some companies are already leading the way on this, with several working together through the likes of WBCSD to identify where they can problem solve collectively, raise ambition levels, drive harmonization, and accelerate the implementation of critical solutions.<br /><br />Diane Holdorf, Executive Vice President, WBCSD, said: ”Food system transformation is a central solution to climate change and agrifood companies have a critical role to play. To meet net-zero targets, businesses must take concerted and ambitious action to de-risk the transition for producers and ensure the costs and benefits of mitigation are shared equitably across the value chain.”<br /><br />Through the Agriculture & Food pathway, WBCSD enables members to accelerate accountability for climate and nature impacts in order take meaningful action in value chains and landscapes and influence and leverage the enabling environment. For example:<br /><br /></p><p><ul><li>WBCSD scope 3 land-based emissions workstream supports companies to accelerate emissions reductions and removals associated with land-use, building on opportunities identified in the scope 3 action agenda for agri-food.</li><li>WBCSD Nature Positive Roadmap provides ‘how to’ guidance to support corporate nature positive strategy development, implementation and disclosure.</li><li>WBCSD is convening 50 members and 27 partner organizations, impacting 1100+ businesses in total – to drive convergence on holistic, outcome-based regenerative agriculture metrics.</li></ul></p><p>To coincide with the Future Fit Food and Agriculture reports, WBCSD has published The Business Case for scope 3 GHG action in agriculture & food value chains which provides perspectives and case studies of different value chain actors regarding the financial costs and benefits. Based on workshops with WBCSD members, this summary report showcases the business case for individual companies in the sector to take action to decarbonize in line with the Paris Agreement and the importance of collaborative action to mobilize finance to implement scope 3 activities.<br /><br />Tags: Pathways | Food & Agriculture<br /><br /></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Food-and-Nature/Food-Land-Use/Scaling-Positive-Agriculture/News/USD-205-billion-per-year-needed-from-agrifood-sector-to-meet-climate-and-nature-targets'>https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Food-and-Nature/Food-Land-Use/Scaling-Positive-Agriculture/News/USD-205-billion-per-year-needed-from-agrifood-sector-to-meet-climate-and-nature-targets</a></p>",

An in-depth assessment by a team of engineers is needed to determine if these buildings can be made safe for future use.<br /><br />The hospital's oxygen plant has been destroyed, leaving Kamal Adwan Hospital as the only source of medical oxygen production in the north. Further comprehensive assessment is essential to evaluate the functionality of vital equipment such as CT scanners, ventilators, sterilization devices, and surgical equip ment, including surgical tools and anaesthesia devices, the agency reported.</p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20240409_m_en/4.jpg' style='width: 100%;' /></p><p>WHO|A multi agency UN team assess the destruction of Al-Shifa Hospital, in Gaza City, following the end of the latest Israeli siege there.</p><p>Shallow graves Numerous shallow graves have been dug just outside the emergency department, and the administrative and surgical buildings, WHO said.<br /><br />“In the same area, many dead bodies were partially buried with their limbs visible. During the visit, WHO staff witnessed at least five bodies lying partially covered on the ground, exposed to the heat” with “a pungent smell of decomposing bodies engulfing the hospital compound.<br /><br />“Safeguarding dignity, even in death, is an indispensable act of humanity”, the agency added.<br /><br />According to the acting Hospital Director, patients were held in abysmal conditions during the siege. They endured severe lack of food, water, healthcare, hygiene and sanitation, and were forced to relocate between buildings at gunpoint. At least 20 patients have reportedly died due to the lack of access to care and limited movement authorized for health personnel.<br /><br />Unnecessary delays<br /><br />Despite deconfliction, Friday’s mission faced significant delays at the military checkpoint en route to Al-Shifa Hospital. On the same day, another WHO-led mission bound for Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan hospitals in northern Gaza – to deliver medical supplies, fuel, deploy emergency medical teams, and support referral of critical patients – encountered unnecessary delays, including the detention of a supply truck driver who was part of the convoy.<br /><br />Between mid-October and the end of March, over half of all WHO missions have been denied, delayed, impeded or postponed. “As health needs soar, the lack of a functional deconfliction system is a major obstacle in delivering humanitarian aid at the scale that is needed”, the UN health agency said.<br /><br />The destruction of Al-Shifa Hospital and Nasser Medical Complex in the southern city of Khan Younis last month, “has broken the backbone of the already ailing health system.”</p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20240409_m_en/5.jpg' style='width: 100%;' /></p><p>UN News/Footage shows the destruction of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza, following the end of the latest Israeli siege.

    "news_content": "<p>09/04/2024 - Record global temperatures around 1.4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial averages led to more heatwaves and floods, longer wildfire seasons and widespread droughts in 2023. A new OECD report details the growing pressure of such climatic events on infrastructure in all sectors, from electricity, communication and transport networks to water and waste treatment, with developing countries often particularly hard hit.<br /><br />The Infrastructure for a Climate-Resilient Future report released today during the OECD Infrastructure Forum, recommends governments systematically factor climate resilience into infrastructure planning and decision-making, including by prioritising sustainable projects, to help reduce societal and economic vulnerability and avoid long-term costs. Climate-resilience measures can also protect investment returns, ensure business continuity and support continued economic growth and development.<br /><br />At the most recent UN Climate Change Conference (COP28), countries committed to increase the resilience of infrastructure by 2030. Countries will need to take action to address this, with regional and local governments playing an essential role, being responsible for 69% of climate-significant public investment in OECD countries.<br /><br />The investments needed to seize these opportunities are significant: according to OECD, World Bank and UN Environment analysis, an annual investment of USD 6.9 trillion in infrastructure will be necessary by 2030 to ensure infrastructure investment is compatible with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement. In parallel, infrastructure assets make up an important share of the economic damages with the economic losses from disasters increasing sevenfold between the 1970s and the 2010s from an average USD 198 billion to USD 1.6 trillion. This, in turn, multiplies the losses (e.g. forgone income) for businesses whose operations are disrupted.<br /><br />“The right type of infrastructure investment can help enhance the quality of growth, by supporting climate action while protecting biodiversity and reducing pollution and enhancing resilience to risks from climate change,” OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said. “But the investments needed are significant. Unlocking private investments in climate resilience will require long-term project planning, reducing regulatory barriers, effective risk-sharing arrangements and, when required, the targeted and strategic use of public support to attract private financing – particularly when the timeline for resilience investment returns may constitute a barrier to private sector participation.”<br /><br />Developing countries are significantly more exposed to climate-related disasters, especially least developed countries (LDCs) and Small Island Development States (SIDS), between 10 and 30 times more than OECD countries. They face important resource shortages and higher financing costs, hindering their ability to build quality infrastructure. In order to address their challenges, the report shows the need for new forms of international partnerships and enhanced mobilisation of resources by development banks.<br /><br />Besides financial resource needs, the report also points to the effectiveness of nature-based solutions – for example using mangroves or coral reefs to reduce risks from coastal floods or storm surges – in providing cost-effective measures to protect infrastructure assets and services.<br /><br />The report provides policymakers and stakeholders with important considerations and tools to support change towards more climate-resilient infrastructure.<br /><br />The Compendium of Good Practices on Quality Infrastructure 2024 was also launched today.</p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/massive-investment-is-needed-in-sustainable-infrastructure-to-build-climate-change-resilience.htm'>https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/massive-investment-is-needed-in-sustainable-infrastructure-to-build-climate-change-resilience.htm</a></p>",

That is the message from officials ahead of “pivotal” talks next week on a legally binding global instrument to end plastic pollution.<br /><br />Delegates from 174 countries are expected to gather in the Canadian capital of Ottawa for the latest round of discussions on the instrument. The gathering, formally known as the Fourth Session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment (INC-4), will run from April 23 to 29. It is the penultimate meeting before negotiations are expected to conclude later this year.<br /><br />“Both people and planet are suffering profoundly from the effects of plastic pollution,” said Jyoti Mathur-Filipp, Executive Secretary of the INC. “This negotiating session is pivotal. It is an opportunity to make significant progress for a robust agreement that would allow future generations to live in a world free of plastic pollution.”<br /><br />The negotiations come amid what experts have called a mounting plastic crisis.<br /><br />Since the 1950s, 9.2 billion tonnes of plastic have been produced, of which 7 billion tonnes have become waste, filling up landfills and polluting lakes, rivers, the soil and the ocean.<br /><br />Humanity now produces 430 million tonnes of plastic each year, two-thirds of which is contained in short-lived products which soon become waste. Some of that plastic winds up in the food chain, where it has the potential to harm human health.<br /><br />The goal during INC-4 is to advance a draft text of the global instrument so it can be finalized in Busan, Republic of Korea in December. The talks so far have focused on reducing pollution during the entire life-cycle of plastics, from their design to their disposal.<br /><br />The negotiating process was formally launched in 2022 at the fifth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly, the world’s top-decision-making body on the environment. It was hailed as a historic moment.<br /><br />After two years of work, the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee has gone from general views to a revised draft text, a development Mathur-Filipp called “a fast result which is a testament to the strong leadership and active engagement to date.”<br /><br />While the timeframe for a final agreement has long been viewed as ambitious, that matches the urgency of the plastic pollution crisis, said Mathur-Filipp.<br /><br />“The science is clear, and the solutions are available to us to end plastic pollution,” she said. “Given that humanity is on track to triple the amount of plastic we produce annually by 2060, it is vital that we continue to make concrete progress and deliver an agreement by the end of this year.”<br /><br />To fight the pervasive impact of pollution on society, UNEP launched #BeatPollution, a strategy for rapid, large-scale and coordinated action against air, land and water pollution. The strategy highlights the impact of pollution on climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and human health. Through science-based messaging, the campaign showcases how transitioning to a pollution-free planet is vital for future generations.<br /><br /></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/critical-negotiations-plastic-pollution-begin-ottawa-canada'>https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/critical-negotiations-plastic-pollution-begin-ottawa-canada</a></p>",

Inhalation can cause damage to the lungs, kidneys and nervous system, while the waste generated can contaminate the immediate area of the spill, as well as a facility’s wastewater.<br /><br />Such equipment breakages are common.<br /><br />Led by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), with funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and executed by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Phasing out mercury measuring devices in healthcare project will develop and implement nation-wide strategies to stop the import, export and manufacture of thermometers and sphygmomanometers, encourage the adoption of accurate, affordable and safe mercury-free alternatives, while improving the management of mercury-containing medical waste.<br /><br />“We need to look at this in the context of One Health,” said Sheila Aggarwal-Khan, Director of UNEP’s Industry and Economy Division. “This initiative is significant, not just for protecting our well-being but because it reduces the impact of healthcare on our shared environment.”<br /><br />The five-year project will bring each country in line with international best practice, educating procurement officers on the efficacy of widely available alternative devices and raising awareness amongst manufacturers and the public, as per WHO recommendations and the Minamata Convention on Mercury.<br /><br />Certain digital thermometers can be up to one-third cheaper than their mercury counterparts when considering the entire lifecycle of both instruments, all while maintaining the same level of clinical accuracy.<br /><br />Director of Public Hygiene at Burkina Faso’s Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene, Dr. Anta Zida, said the country was keenly aware of the need to reform its healthcare sector to meet Burkina Faso’s international obligations.<br /><br />“Eliminating medical devices containing mercury in healthcare facilities is saving lives and protecting the environment” she said.<br /><br />“The healthcare sector serves to protect and improve public health; this project will further demonstrate the important leadership role that the sector has in promoting sustainability,” said Dr Maria Neira, Director, Climate Change, Environment and Health at WHO.<br /><br />The project aims to phase out mercury-added thermometers and sphygmomanometers at a rate of 20 percent per year, reducing spillages by 23,350kg and improving the lives of over 1.8 million people.<br /><br />NOTES TO EDITORS<br /><br />About the Global Environment Facility<br /><br />The Global Environment Facility (GEF) is a multilateral family of funds dedicated to confronting biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution, and supporting land and ocean health.

It outlines the dependencies and uncertainties across various possible temperature and energy system outcomes. <br /><br />The original version of the Catalogue was developed in 2022, responding to recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD). Since its launch, many companies leveraged the Catalogue in their TCFD disclosures for climate scenario analysis and scenario comparisons, e.g., BP and Mitsubishi. <br /><br />The updated Energy Climate Scenario Catalogue v3.0 contains 18 scenarios from six leading scenario providers, with variables across investment, demand, emissions, capacity, cost, and price. The Catalogue allows for the navigation, comparison, and exploration of scenarios over time.  <br /><br />In version 3.0, scenarios were updated to reflect the latest scenario publications. The Catalogue will continue to be updated to incorporate future scenario developments. <br /><br />Along with the Catalogue, the Climate Scenario Analysis Reference Approach report expresses the Energy Forum’s rationale, principles, process, and reflections regarding scenario analysis efforts. It explores the business use of climate scenario analysis and outlines principles for making choices using the Catalogue, with examples of use cases. The report also outlines allocating various public climate scenarios to three scenario reference families (aligned with 1.5°C, 2°C and current policies/BAU). <br /><br />WBCSD convened BASF, BHP, BP, CLP, CRH, EDF, Enel, Engie, Equinor, Holcim, Iberdrola, and Skanska – the Energy Forum – to develop business-relevant approaches to climate scenario analysis. This work was conducted in response to recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), as well as guidance from International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), and U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission.  <br /><br />McKinsey Sustainability provided methodological and technical support for the Energy Climate Scenario Catalogue.<br /><br />This work continues to support companies in following ISSB, ESRS and SEC recommendations to assess their strategic resilience by considering different climate-related scenarios. The resources updated today align with WBCSD’s strategic priorities in climate action and supporting member companies in engaging capital markets on ESG performance.<br /><br />The Climate Scenario Analysis Reference Approach report is available here.<br /><br />The Energy Climate Scenario Catalogue v3.0 is available here.  Versions 2.0 and 1.0 of the Catalogue remain available here and here.</p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/News-Insights/General/News/WBCSD-unveils-Enhanced-Energy-Climate-Scenario-Catalogue-3.0-for-strategic-climate-resilience-assessments '>https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/News-Insights/General/News/WBCSD-unveils-Enhanced-Energy-Climate-Scenario-Catalogue-3.0-for-strategic-climate-resilience-assessments</a></p>",

Their incorporation showcased the need to revise the Standards’ titles. Until this point, Universal Standards were number-coded as 100s, followed by the Topic Standards as 200s, 300s, and 400s.<br /><br />In search of a clear and straight-forward way to integrate Sector Standards into this structure, it was decided that the whole naming convention would transition into a three-tier coding system:</p><p><ul><li>Universal Standards are known by single-digit numbers (GRI 1, 2 and 3.)</li><li>Sector Standards are identified by a double-digit number, (starting with GRI 11: Oil and Gas) continuing in ascending order based on the release date for new Sector Standards.</li><li>Topic Standards are identified with three-digit codes (starting with GRI 101: Biodiversity 2024), an approach that new or revised Topic Standards will follow in ascending order, as they become available. </li></ul></p><p>Under the new system, the GRI Standards are structured and presented in a way that is more intuitive and reflects GRI’s integrated and complete modular system of reporting. In addition, since the previous approach was based on dividing standards into three subsets of economic, environmental and social topics, the multiple dimensions of impacts contained in some Standards made this approach challenging and restrictive.<br /><br />The Global Sustainability Standards Board (GSSB) – the independent body responsible for developing and setting the GRI Standards – has developed a work program for standards development, following this naming system.<br /><br />There are ongoing projects to create new Sector Standards – like the Sector Standards Project for Financial Services; and revised or new Topic Standards – such as the Topic Standards Project for Labor. As Topic Standards are progressively launched, they will replace the former ones and their naming will be changed following the new convention.</p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.globalreporting.org/news/news-center/understanding-the-new-naming-system-of-the-gri-standards/'>https://www.globalreporting.org/news/news-center/understanding-the-new-naming-system-of-the-gri-standards/</a></p>",

This is the biggest year-on-year increase to date and means that the 100 billion mark was reached a year earlier than the OECD had previously projected, albeit two years later than the initial target date of 2020.</p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20240605_m_en/2.png' style='width: 100%;' /></p><p>The gap in the private finance series in 2015 is due to the implementation of enhanced measurement methodologies. As a result, private flows for 2016-22 cannot be directly compared with private flows for 2013-14.<br /><br />Source: OECD (2024), Climate Finance Provided and Mobilised by Developed Countries in 2013-2022.<br /><br />Climate Finance Provided and Mobilised by Developed Countries in 2013-2022 is the OECD’s seventh assessment of progress towards the UNFCCC goal, agreed in 2009, of mobilising USD 100 billion a year by 2020 – a commitment later extended through to 2025 – to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change. It comes as UNFCCC discussions are under way to set a New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance for the post-2025 period, taking into account developing countries’ needs and priorities as well as the evolving global economic landscape.<br /><br />“It is good to see that developed countries have exceeded the USD 100 billion goal in 2022. Exceeding this annual commitment materially by more than 15% is an important and symbolic achievement which goes some way towards making up for the two year delay, which should help build trust. We encourage developed countries to keep up the momentum, also to leverage it further with additional policy efforts to boost private climate finance,” OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said. “It will be important to sustain this level of elevated support through to 2025 while also increasing our ambition for the new post-2025 goal. Multilateral providers and the private sector will be key to further bridging the investment gap, notably in areas such as clean energy, agriculture and resilience. For the post-2025 period, the scope and design of the New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance must be more comprehensive and effective than the existing goal by optimising the roles of different actors, finance sources, and policy incentives in order to address the scale and range of climate-related finance needs.”<br /><br />Additional OECD analysis published this week highlights the need for the NCQG on climate finance to reflect and incentivise contributions from a broad range of sources in line with the scale of investment needed to achieve the Paris Agreement’s goals. The report explores ways the new goal could incorporate elements relating to public interventions that can either directly finance climate action or help mobilise private climate finance. It also discusses options for factoring in elements related to the quality of finance, as well as addressing key issues faced by developing countries such as access to finance and the sustainability of debt.<br /><br />The 2022 climate finance data shows that public funds, from both bilateral and multilateral channels, continue to make up the bulk of climate finance, accounting for 80% of the total. Over the period recorded, multilateral public climate finance showed the biggest rise, up by USD 35 billion or 226% since 2013. The 2022 growth in public climate finance was accompanied by a jump of 52%, or USD 7.5 billion, in mobilised private finance, which reached USD 21.9 billion in 2022 after several years of relative stagnation.<br /><br />The figures also show an uptick in climate finance destined for adaptation action. Following a small drop in 2021, adaptation finance reached USD 32.4 billion in 2022, three times the 2016 level. The amount of public adaptation finance tracked by the OECD in 2019 was USD 18.8 billion and USD 20.3 billion with mobilised private finance included. Based on these figures, in 2022, developed countries were about halfway towards meeting the 2019 COP26 Glasgow Climate Pact’s call to double the provision of adaptation finance by 2025.<br /><br />As with previous OECD assessments, this year’s edition provides insights relating to financial instruments as well as geographical distribution of climate finance. It shows that loans continue to represent the lion’s share of public climate finance, especially for multilateral development banks that typically finance large infrastructure projects, although grants are being prioritised in lower-income countries. The mix is more balanced for multilateral climate funds and bilateral providers, owing to a larger and more diverse range of activities and projects. Between 2016 and 2022, grants increased by USD 13.4 billion (more than doubling with an increase of 109%) and public loans by USD 30.3 billion (up 91%).<br /><br />Climate finance to low-income countries remained relatively low at 10% in 2022. Importantly, however, least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS), benefitted from a larger amount of finance for adaptation (about 50%) than the average for all developing countries (25%). On the other hand, private mobilised finance for LDCs and SIDS was very limited, underscoring the need for tailored international support to help address the challenges faced by these countries in attracting private investment for climate action.<br /><br />The OECD will continue to track the fulfillment of the USD 100 billion goal through to 2025 as well as, pending the outcome of COP29 in Baku, contributing to international efforts to implement the NCQG in an effective way.<br /><br />Download Climate Finance Provided and Mobilised by Developed Countries in 2013-2022, as part of the OECD book series on Climate Finance and the USD 100 Billion Goal.<br /><br />Download The New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance: Options for reflecting the role of different sources, actors, and qualitative considerations.</p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/developed-countries-materially-surpassed-their-usd-100-billion-climate-finance-commitment-in-2022-oecd.htm'>https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/developed-countries-materially-surpassed-their-usd-100-billion-climate-finance-commitment-in-2022-oecd.htm</a></p>",

It is reinforcing its commitment toward forest-positive landscape transformation and the preservation of the Cerrado. Starting with 25 municipalities in 2019, the SCF’s monitoring and reporting included bi-annual reports on sourced soy volumes and farm-level traceability. These municipalities were selected to prioritize the SCF’s efforts in areas with the greatest deforestation risk linked to soy cultivation. By 2021, following a public consultation, the monitoring and reporting scope expanded to 61 municipalities, covering 26% of the Cerrado’s soy cultivation area and capturing a significantly larger portion of converted native vegetation.<br /><br />From 2024 onwards, the SCF will further broaden its monitoring and reporting scope to the entire Cerrado biome and implement an enhanced risk assessment methodology for classifying non-traceable soy (outlined below). Moreover, to ensure transparency and comparability, the SCF will also report on the 61 municipalities using both the old and new methodologies in its 2024 report.</p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20240621_m_en/1.png' style='width: 100%;' /></p><p>SCF Scope expansion: Moving from 61 focus municipalities to over 800 municipalities in the entire Cerrado</p><p>This effort broadened monitoring and reporting scope and enhanced methodology aligns with the Agri-trader Roadmap to 1.5°C. It strengthens the SCF’s ability to support forest-positive soy supply chains and promotes sustainable agriculture and environmental conservation in the Cerrado.<br /><br />This expansion to the entire Cerrado is significant because the biome covers an area equivalent to the combined size of England, Germany, Spain, France, and Italy. This represents a remarkable 1,124% increase from the SCF’s initial 25 municipalities scope (17.79 million hectares).<br /><br />Enhanced Risk-Assessment Methodology<br /><br />The SCF’s Monitoring Land Use workstream initially assessed member companies’ direct soy sourcing in the Cerrado. In 2022, the SCF marked a significant milestone in its Deforestation- and Conversion-Free (DCF) journey by verifying each member’s DCF performance for direct sourcing and through a third-party verification process, using a dedicated audit protocol. Since its December 2022 report, the SCF also started reporting on indirect supplier engagement, paving the way toward enhanced supply-chain monitoring and traceability.<br /><br />With the SCF’s 2024 land use monitoring and reporting expansion to the entire Cerrado, an enhanced risk assessment methodology tailored for indirect sourcing, will be implemented to optimize resource allocation by focusing on high-risk areas (municipalities with over 1% of their soy area produced on deforested or converted land) while still monitoring low risk, established agricultural zones. This strategic focus is intended to maximize the impact of the SCF’s resources in combating deforestation and conversion.<br /><br />The new set of reporting indicators consists of seven indicators for direct and indirect sourcing:</p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20240621_m_en/4.png' style='width: 100%;' /></p><p>Additionally, the SCF prioritizes compliance with cropping polygons over entire farms for accurate monitoring and direct sourcing will require farm-level traceability to ensure DCF compliance.<br /><br />For indirect suppliers, a new radius-based analysis will assess risk levels based on deforestation and conversion overlaps with soy cropsusing a specific threshold for considering soy volumes as DCF. To establish DCF compliance of indirect suppliers, traceability will be done to the sourcing farms, at farm-level for more accurate data. Alternatively, deforestation and conversion risk may be assessed by considering municipalities as DCF if soy production on deforested land is up to 1% of the total soy production area. For municipalities exceeding 1% soy production over deforested land, a 50km-radius buffer analysis will be applied to evaluate risk, categorizing a portion of soy received from these warehouses as deforestation-linked.<br /><br />Partnering with indirect soy suppliers in the Cerrado, including soy resellers, cooperatives and third-party warehouses, presents a crucial avenue to achieving traceability of DCF soy sourcing. The 2024 enhanced methodology joins forces with other sectoral efforts to engage indirect suppliers to increase their traceability and achieve DCF performance.<br /><br />The aim of the SCF’s scope expansion and enhanced methodology is to effectively monitor and verify DCF soy volumes across the whole value chain and to measure progress over time. In its upcoming 2024 annual report, the SCF will continue reporting its current methodology for the 61 focus municipalities while also incorporating the new methodology outlined above, covering both the 61 municipalities and the entire Cerrado.<br /><br />This dual approach ensures transparency and comparability, including an enhanced risk assessment to classify non-traceable soy, providing stakeholders with clear sustainability credentials of sourced soy.

    "news_content": "<p>Published 01 July, 2024 / Type WBCSD insights<br /><br />Authors Daniel Galis, Associate, Energy<br /><br />Decarbonizing heat generation and use in industries represents a major challenge in the energy transition. Heat accounts for most of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for industrial businesses in sectors such as food and beverage, paper and pulp, fast-moving consumer goods, and chemicals. In 2021, the way we generated and used heat was responsible for a total of 14.1Gt CO2, equal to 39% of all energy-related CO2 emissions.<br /><br />An additional 15EJ of renewable heat must be generated by 2028 to achieve net-zero by 2050 – an ambitious goal compared to the mere 2.5EJ added in the past five years. So far, the uptake of modern renewable heating technologies has been limited due to the lack of awareness about viable options, high investment and upfront costs, and local barriers associated with renewable heating solutions – among others, the availability of land and solar radiation for solar thermal as well as availability of additional electricity supply for heat pumps. According to the IEA, emerging business models, including Heat-as-a-Service (HaaS) can help us overcome some of these challenges by mobilizing the necessary investments.<br /><br />HaaS is a financing model in which an industrial company outsources its heating needs to a specialized provider, an energy service company (ESCO). The ESCO finances, builds and operates the renewable heat generation asset and subsequently sells the heat produced to the industrial company.<br/><br/>The Heat as a Service structure</p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20240730_m_en/2.png' style='width: 100%;' />Source: WBCSD analysis, depiction based on WBCSD (2021), Heat as a service: How to decarbonize commercial and industrial heat use with third-party capital investments</p><p>The HaaS arrangement enables a company to access decarbonized heat, replacing fossil fuels and realizing operational cost savings, all without the need for an upfront investment. The ESCO contributes with its specialized knowledge in developing, optimizing, and integrating a broad spectrum of renewable heating technologies. As the ESCO owns the asset, it is motivated to choose the most effective solution and constantly innovate to improve performance. Meanwhile, the industrial company can avoid the ancillary costs associated with new technologies, such as staff reskilling, and focus internal financial and personnel resources towards its core business instead of energy supply.<br/><br/>Headwinds to large scale adoption<br/><br/>While the HaaS model offers compelling advantages, many companies remain hesitant about its adoption. The biggest issue is the long-term nature of the contract, in place to allow the ESCO to recuperate its investment costs. Companies need to rely on the ESCO with their heat supply for the full 15 to 20-year typical duration of the contract. Importantly, any technical, operational, or financial difficulties encountered by the ESCO throughout this time could result in disruptions to heat provision. As industrial companies typically require stable heat input, such disruptions would interrupt their production and lead to losses in revenue. Because of this, HaaS is often considered as a leap of faith for companies accustomed to owning their own heat generation assets. For HaaS to be seen as a potential solution, the organizational mindset would need to shift significantly.<br/><br/>In our journey towards Net Zero on our Low Carbon Transition Plan, decarbonizing heating to reduce our scope 1 emissions is crucial. For international businesses in general, many with factories worldwide running at high capacity, a steady supply of thermal energy is vital for business continuity.<br/>– Philip Morris International<br/><br/>Another challenge is posed by the fact that heat needs to be consumed close to its generation point as it cannot be transported over long distances. Unlike Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), which may be more easily transferable between sites within a single jurisdiction, the mobility of HaaS contracts is constrained by the physical infrastructure. Any transfer would necessitate the equipment’s relocation, which, even if technically possible, would lead to supply interruptions and financial losses for the industrial company.  The limited transferability of HaaS agreements creates additional complexity and poses a specific challenge in case of any unexpected reduction in the energy demand at the production site.<br/><br/>While HaaS shows great promise as a potential solution for decarbonization across different contexts, because it’s in the early stages, its viability requires further proof through real projects. For example, potential challenges like bankability, supplier reliability, geographical factors, global energy price fluctuations, and contractual tenures could make HaaS adoption complex.<br/>– Philip Morris International<br/><br/>How to deliver a successful HaaS project?<br/><br/>Engaging in a dialogue with WBCSD members and industry experts, we analyzed existing projects based on HaaS agreements and identified three key learnings that address some of the concerns and reveal valuable lessons from real-life implementations.<br/><br/>1. Prioritize finding a committed, flexible, and stable HaaS partner<br/><br/>The adoption of HaaS extends beyond a typical supplier-client dynamic, evolving into a long-term partnership. Companies stress the significance of selecting the right trustworthy and reliable partner early in the project’s timeline. Because of this, ESCOs should employ novel approaches to build the relationship early on and mitigate any concerns faced by the industrial company. In some HaaS projects, ESCOs assume the full project risk until the renewable heat solution is operational, showing their commitment to the project. Similarly, other ESCOs offer short-term one-year-long HaaS agreements using a smaller pilot installation which can then be extended to a full project following the feedback from the industrial company.<br/><br/>Financial stability is another crucial factor companies look for, especially given the potential repercussions on production in the event of the ESCO’s financial distress. This is of particular concern because, so far, the market has been primarily served by startups. However, an increasing number of established utilities, such as Engie, are exploring HaaS. They can complement the services provided by the startups and alleviate many of the reliability and financial stability concerns.<br/><br/>One of the primary reasons we chose Engie as our partner was expertise. We, at Heineken, are experts in brewing beer but Engie is expert in providing energy solutions.<br/>– HEINEKEN España <br/><br/>2. Develop a long-term energy procurement strategy<br/><br/>For a successful HaaS agreement, the ESCO needs to model the industrial company’s heat demand over the duration of the contract. This is necessary to scale and optimize the renewable heat solution to the right capacity and, in turn, lower the costs for the industrial company. HaaS, therefore, necessitates a certain level of maturity in the company’s energy procurement, so that it can anticipate its heat needs and develop an optimized cost-effective procurement strategy. At a minimum, companies need to have available data on their current heat profile and heat demand. Ideally, they should also develop a long-term energy and decarbonization strategy that maps their targets and requirements for the upcoming years. The HaaS contracts are then a powerful tool to enable long-term planning as they enable companies, similarly to power purchase agreements, to lock in their price of heat for years to come. This is particularly advantageous for companies that currently rely on natural gas which often suffers from volatile prices due to unpredictable geopolitical events.<br/><br/>Implementing HaaS requires mature internal energy procurement capabilities. Companies should be able to forecast their future energy demand, assess the impacts of carbon pricing, and have a clear decarbonization strategy.<br/>– Newheat<br/><br/>Additionally, a well-defined energy and decarbonization strategy can help companies secure internal stakeholder alignment and support for renewable heat solutions. Tangible goals to reduce emissions from production focused on the near future up to 2030 prove vital to get projects off the ground and drive renewable heat adoption.<br/><br/>3. Leverage the HaaS partnership to acquire subsidies<br/><br/>While many renewable heat technologies for temperatures below 200°C are mature enough for commercial-scale deployment, they are often more expensive upfront than their fossil fuel counterparts. The true cost of carbon is often not properly reflected in investment decisions as well, making renewable heating solutions seem financially unviable. As the market expands and suppliers achieve economies of scale, utilities expect the costs to decrease significantly. For now, however, we are still in the early market stages and subsidies on both the investment and operational costs of renewable heat solutions are needed to enhance the commercial attractiveness of projects.<br/><br/>As a result, some ESCOs proactively look for subsidies to support their projects and help companies secure them as part of the HaaS agreement. Engie, for example, acquired the subsidy from the European Regional Development Fund which co-funded 60% of the investment costs required for its 30MW solar thermal HaaS project with Heineken in Seville. Additionally, the HaaS arrangement allows companies to benefit from governmental support for the operational costs, such as the Dutch SDE++, which covers the difference between the cost of conventional and renewable heat generation.<br/><br/>The time to decarbonize heat generation through HaaS is now<br/><br/>The partnership with energy experts via the HaaS model offers companies the comfort of specialized knowledge and reduces the need for substantial upfront investments, allowing them to concentrate their resources on core business operations. This is particularly valuable as modern renewable heating solutions are constantly evolving and developing. While there are inherent challenges to the HaaS model – such as long-term contract commitments and dependence on the ESCO’s financial stability – these can be mitigated by selecting a reliable partner and developing strategic long-term planning. Effectively implemented, the HaaS model can act as a key catalyst for the broader adoption of renewable heating solutions, driving industry towards a sustainable and net-zero future.<br/><br/>What’s next<br/><br/>You can find more information about the HaaS partnership between Heineken and Engie as well as about the largest solar thermal power plant in Europe in the accompanying case study on The Climate Drive.

It is hugely reassuring that they can apply their existing disclosure practices to meet ESRS requirements. Our ongoing collaboration with EFRAG future proofs the relevance of the GRI Standards in the EU, while our broader engagements with the IFRS Foundation and other jurisdictions is reinforcing on a global scale the many benefits of impact reporting with GRI.”</p><p><ul><li>Launched this month is a new GRI-ESRS Linkage Service that offers feedback to reporting organizations on how to align a GRI sustainability report with the ESRS</li><li>A new series of GRI Academy training courses specifically focused on the ESRS will become available this year</li><li>A Top 10 summary version of the GRI-ESRS Q&A is also available</li></ul></p><p>The CSRD disclosure requirements initially applies to 42,500 companies as of January 2024. This includes large companies in the EU and those listed on European stock exchanges. Additionally, some large non-EU companies will be in scope from 2028.<br/><br/>The GRI Standards are the most used sustainability reporting standards by European companies. The ESRS mandates reporting on all material impacts, risks, and opportunities; where they lack coverage (such as in tax or sector-specific standards) companies can use GRI reporting to fill the gap to ensure full compliance.<br/><br/>GRI signed an initial MoU in 2021 with EFRAG to co-construct the first set of ESRS. A new cooperation agreement was reached in November 2023, which substantiates the benefits of the alignment achieved between the ESRS and the GRI Standards and commits the organizations to continue working together to deliver technical support for reporting companies.<br/><br/>The high degree of interoperability between the ESRS and GRI Standards was confirmed in a joint statement issued by EFRAG and GRI in September 2023.<br/><br/>In May 2024, a collaboration between GRI, Pascal Durand (MEP and CSRD Rapporteur), and the Lefebvre Sarrut Group led to the publication of CSRD Essentials: a free resource covering the key implementation themes of the new EU directive.</p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.globalreporting.org/news/news-center/gri-best-prepares-companies-for-csrd-reporting-rules/'>https://www.globalreporting.org/news/news-center/gri-best-prepares-companies-for-csrd-reporting-rules/</a></p>",

This year’s theme was Reinforcing the 2030 Agenda and eradicating poverty in times of multiple crises:  the effective delivery of sustainable, resilient and innovative solutions.<br/><br/>The session included a three-day ministerial segment from 15 to 17 July as part of the High-Level Segment of the Council.<br/><br/>Key votes on ministerial declaration<br/><br/>The adoption of a ministerial declaration, a key outcome of the Forum, was marked by robust debate among Member States, culminating in two key votes on amendments.<br/><br/>One proposal involved the inclusion of a paragraph “strongly urging” States to refrain from promulgating and applying any unilateral economic, financial or trade measures not in accordance with international law and the UN Charter that impede the full achievement of economic and social development, in particular in developing countries.<br/><br/>The inclusion – proposed among others by Belarus, Cuba, Iran, Russia and Syria – was agreed with a recorded vote of 105 nations in favour, 11 against and 46 abstentions.<br/><br/>The other amendment, proposed by Israel called for the deletion of a paragraph that “recognized” that sustainable development cannot be realized without peace and security, and peace and security will be at risk without sustainable development.<br/><br/>That paragraph also called for “further effective measures and actions” to be taken, in conformity with international law, to remove the obstacles to the full realization of the right to self-determination of peoples living under colonial and foreign occupation, which continue to adversely affect their economic and social development as well as the environment.<br/><br/>In a recorded vote, the Forum decided to retain this paragraph, with 122 Member States voting for retention and two voting for deletion (Israel and United States). Thirty-nine States abstained.<br/><br/>The ministerial declaration, as amended, was then adopted without a vote.</p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20240730_m_en/5.jpg' style='width: 100%;' />UN Photo/Manuel Elías / Paula Narváez Ojeda, President of the Economic and Social Council, addresses the ministerial opening of the High-level Political Forum 2024.</p><p>Commitment renewed<br/><br/>Addressing the Forum after the adoption, Paula Narváez, ECOSOC President, highlighted that the ministerial declaration “reinforced once again” the urgency of implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.<br/><br/>“This high-level political forum has highlighted that it is not too late to make sustainable development a reality.”<br/><br/>She also recognized the efforts of Ambassador José Blanco of the Dominican Republic and Ambassador Merete Fjeld Brattested of Norway for their leadership as facilitators of “complex negotiations, which were conducted in an exceptional, transparent and inclusive manner”.<br/><br/>Complex, inclusive negotiations<br/><br/>She added that delegations negotiated for over 70 hours, with 20 informal and 3 informal-informal sessions, “making every effort to bring together the different opposing positions and present an ambitious and balanced document”.<br/><br/>The ECOSOC President concluded by stressing the body’s collective resolve to accelerate the implementation of SDGs and advance sustainable development, and to undertake the transformations necessary to achieve that objective.<br/><br/>“We will continue to renew multilateral efforts to fulfil the promise of the 2030 Agenda and leave no one behind,” she said.</p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20240730_m_en/6.png' style='width: 100%;' /></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/07/1152276'>https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/07/1152276</a></p>",

Here are excerpts from that conversation.<br/><br/>These Olympics are the first since the International Olympic Committee joined the UNEP-supported Sports for Nature initiative. Launched in 2022, the effort provides a game plan for sports at all levels to become better stewards of nature. Why is that important?<br/><br/>Susan Gardner (SG): Right now, human activities are putting ecosystems under enormous pressure, with a growing number of species facing the prospect of extinction from the impacts of nature loss, climate change and pollution.<br/><br/>Ending this crisis will take a concerted effort from many big actors, like governments and businesses. But sports federations have a role to play, too. At a minimum, they have an obligation to do no harm to the environment. At their best they can help inspire a new movement for nature, and encourage their billions of followers to protect and restore the planet.<br/><br/>How exactly can sports help counter the nature crisis?<br/><br/>SG: Sport for Nature has a simple, four-point plan that focuses on conserving nature, restoring what has been lost, reducing the drawdown on nature through more sustainable procurement, and inspiring players and fans to get involved.<br/><br/>It does these things in a combination of ways, including by providing sports with resources, and hosting events and webinars.<br/><br/>Are sports becoming more sustainable?<br/><br/>SG: Sustainability is becoming increasingly important for sports. But still, sustainability departments are often lightly resourced and over-tasked, meaning that while progress is being made, the pace is slower than many would like.<br/><br/>That said, many sports federations have begun to take concrete steps to lighten their footprint on nature. A prime example is the International Olympic Committee, which has developed a plan to embed sustainability into the Olympics and provide lasting benefits to host countries and their citizens.<br/><br/>That’s already manifesting itself this year. In Paris, civic officials have launched a US$1.5 billion effort to clean and restore the Seine River, which had been unswimmable for more than 50 years.<br/><br/>Another example is World Rugby. It has developed a 10-point plan for delivering for nature, which is being shared with clubs across Europe and the Pacific.<br/><br/>Finally, the Sport for Climate Action movement, supported by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, has helped many sports reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and reached impressive outcomes.<br/><br/>What impact has Sport for Nature had so far? <br/><br/>SG: It is a young initiative, so while we can’t judge it yet, it is making progress and has 62 signatories. Many are taking action to support the Biodiversity Plan, a landmark global accord to protect and restore the natural world.<br/><br/>Sport for Nature is a partnership between UNEP, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the International Olympic Committee and the Convention on Biological Diversity, with the support of Dona Bertarelli Philanthropy. This collaborative approach is working well but for many sports this is a new area which is not fully understood yet. We hope to change that in the coming months. Because with its incredible reach and influence, the sports world can showcase to the planet the importance of safeguarding our ecosystems. <br/><br/>What practical steps can sports organizations take to protect and restore nature? <br/><br/>SG: Sports depend on the ecosystems they play within but often in urban environments, nature has no home. It doesn’t have to be like that. Sports officials can incorporate natural elements into venues, such as green roofs and insect boxes, and design training grounds to provide habitats for native species.<br/><br/>When choosing venues for outdoor sports, like skiing, surfing and cycling, sports leaders can steer clear of ecologically sensitive areas. They can also ensure the landscapes they do use are protected.<br/><br/>“With its incredible reach and influence, the sports world can showcase to the planet the importance of safeguarding our ecosystems.”-Susan Gardner, UNEP.<br/><br/>The world is in the grip of a triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste. How is this affecting the sports world? <br/><br/>SG: In many ways. Extreme heat and air pollution, for example, are affecting the health of athletes and playing havoc with the scheduling of competitions. Climate change is leading to more extreme weather, with things like floods threatening sporting venues and other event-related infrastructure. These impacts will sadly only increase, with even more tragic consequences for climate-vulnerable communities, unless we act with urgency now. <br/><br/>Can nature help counter those threats? <br/><br/>SG: Yes. Nature can be a real ally in sustaining sports and allowing them to thrive. Planting trees around stadia, for example, can increase cooling. Restoring wetlands, which regulate the availability of water, can enhance resilience and prevent pitches from flooding. And cleaning rivers allows them once again to become sporting venues. In doing these things, the sports world can offer a template for how to protect and restore nature, and serve as a role model for governments, businesses and individuals everywhere. <br/><br/>The crisis confronting nature is urgent. We need everyone, including the sports world, to work together to safeguard our ecosystems. <br/><br/>Sports for Nature <br/><br/>Sports for Nature is a joint initiative of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the International Olympic Committee, the United Nations Environment Programme, the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Dona Bertarelli Philanthropy.  <br/><br/>It aims to deliver transformative action for nature protection and restoration across sports, by 2030 and beyond. It provides a game plan for sports — at all levels — to accelerate and inspire others to take action for nature. <br/><br/>The Biodiversity Plan<br/><br/>The planet is experiencing a dangerous decline in nature. One million species are threatened with extinction, soil health is declining and water sources are drying up. The Biodiversity Plan, formerly known as the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, sets out global targets to halt and reverse nature loss by 2030. It was adopted by world leaders in December 2022. To address the drivers of the nature crisis, UNEP is working with partners to take action in landscapes and seascapes, transform our food systems, and close the finance gap for nature.</p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/olympics-are-part-push-green-sports-heres-why-thats-important'>https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/olympics-are-part-push-green-sports-heres-why-thats-important</a></p>",

Germany also experienced a large increase in real household income per capita compared with the previous quarter (1.4% versus 0.1%), partly driven by a rise in compensation of employees, while real GDP per capita1 picked up (0.2%) compared with the previous quarter (minus 0.6%). Canada saw an increase in real household income per capita (0.6%), a rebound from Q4 2023 (minus 0.5%), while real GDP per capita fell for the fourth consecutive quarter (minus 0.2%). France registered growth in real household income per capita (0.6%), supported mainly by an increase in basic pension benefits to keep pace with inflation. The United Kingdom and the United States saw milder increases in real household income per capita (of 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively).<br/><br/>Most other OECD countries also recorded rises in real household income per capita in Q1 2024. Poland saw the largest increase (10.2%), mainly driven by increases in compensation of employees, social benefits other than social transfers in kind, and property income. The latter more than tripled in Poland since the end of 2021, mainly due to increased interest receipts in view of higher interest rates. The largest contraction in real household income per capita was recorded in Greece (minus 1.9%), although real GDP per capita grew (0.9%).</p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20240821_m_en/2.png' style='width: 100%;' /></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=HH_DASH'>OECD (2024) Household Dashboard (Database)</a></p><p>Note<br/>1.Revised benchmark data has not yet been incorporated for Germany.</p><p>Methodology<br><a target='_blank' href='https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/data/methods/QSA-Methodological-Note.pdf'>Methodological Notes: OECD Growth and economic well-being (PDF) </a></p><p>Release dates<br>Next release: 13 November 2024<br><a target='_blank' href='https://www.oecd.org/en/data/insights/statistical-releases/2024/01/release-dates-for-oecd-statistics-news-releases.html'>All release dates</a></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.oecd.org/en/data/insights/statistical-releases/2024/08/growth-and-economic-well-being-first-quarter-2024-oecd1.html'>https://www.oecd.org/en/data/insights/statistical-releases/2024/08/growth-and-economic-well-being-first-quarter-2024-oecd1.html</a></p>",

During its annual executive meeting last February, the Council presented a declaration proposing principles of responsible AI. These principles were ratiﬁed by Forética’s Board of Directors and further developed through collaboration with experts in the ﬁeld, contributions from  the ‘AI on ESG’ platform, and input from responsible AI and corporate sustainability executives.A technical team from Accenture also supported the initiative, ensuring alignment with both the most stringent international standards and the European Artiﬁcial Intelligence Law.<br/><br/>The Manifesto was presented to the Spanish Minister for Digital Transformation and Public Administration, José Luis Escrivá, and the Secretary of State for Digitalization and Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Mayte Ledo. Representing the companies and organizations adhering to the Manifesto were Alberto Granados, president of Forética, Mercedes Oblanca, member of the Spanish Business Council for Sustainable Development led by Forética where she promoted the responsible AI initiative, Ignasi Belda, general director of the Spanish Agency for the Supervision of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AESIA), and Ana Herrero, director of Sustainable Transformation at Forética.<br/><br/>This document is intended to serve as an awareness-raising and inspirational tool, urging companies and organizations to develop and continuously improve corporate policies that support the principles of responsible and sustainable AI and transform them into action, going beyond what is required by law. Notably, this is the ﬁrst AI Manifesto to focus on a holistic view of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues in Europe.<br/><br/>A total of 70 companies and organizations have conﬁrmed their support for the Manifesto : Accenture, Acción contra el Hambre, ADAMS Formación, Adif, Airbus, Antolín, AstraZeneca, Atresmedia, Grupo Cooperativo Cajamar, Bankinter, BERGNER, BMW, Brico Depôt, Capital Energy, Cecabank, CELSA Group, CEMEX, Cepsa, Cesce, Chiesi, Coca-Cola Europaciﬁc Partners, Ecoembes, Enagás, Endesa, ENGIE, Enusa, Eulen, Exolum, FEIQUE, Ferrovial, Fundación ONCE, Galletas Gullón, Gómez- Acebo y Pombo, GoSupply, Grupo Asisa, Grupo ILUNION, Grupo Oesía, GSK, Holcim, Iberdrola, IBM, Indra, Informa D&B, Instituto de Crédito Oﬁcial (ICO), ISS, KPMG, Lactalis, Lilly, L’Oréal, Mahou San Miguel, ManpowerGroup, Metrovacesa, Microsoft, Mutualidad, NTT Data, PEFC España, PRISA, Prosegur, Repsol, SAP, SEO/BirdLife, SEPI, Servimedia, Smurﬁt Kappa, Solunion, Solvay, Técnicas Reunidas, Transcendent, Vodafone y Workiva.<br/><br/>As a next step, Forética will promote the extension of support for these principles, starting, in the ﬁrst place, with its more than 200 member companies and organizations. In addition, it will create a community of practice to periodically review and update the Manifesto.</p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.wbcsd.org/news/global-network-spain-70-companies-and-organizations-support-foreticas-manifesto-for-responsible-and-sustainable-arti%ef%ac%81cial-intelligence/'>https://www.wbcsd.org/news/global-network-spain-70-companies-and-organizations-support-foreticas-manifesto-for-responsible-and-sustainable-arti%ef%ac%81cial-intelligence/</a></p>",

Some 500,000 people in the key rice-growing region could be affected.<br/><br/>The UN World Food Programme (WFP) said that initial reports indicated that hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland have been inundated. In the hardest-hit areas, urgent needs include basic food, drinking water, and sanitation.<br/><br/>The emergency compounds the dire situation across vast areas of Myanmar more than three years since a military coup that has led to escalating fighting, surging displacement and extreme protection threats.<br/><br/>Initially, WFP plans to assist some 35,000 people now sheltering in evacuation centres in Ayeyarwady. Food packs include rice and fortified biscuits, along with nutrition support for mothers and children, to prevent acute malnutrition.<br/><br/>Sheela Matthew, WFP Representative in Myanmar, warned that the flooding “threatens to significantly reduce monsoon rice yields” and will likely “jeopardize the food security of smallholder farmers”.<br/><br/>Vast challenges<br/><br/>She added that the impacts of the rising waters “are likely to be felt not just in Ayeyarwady but more broadly across Myanmar”, hence WFP’s response “to help mitigate potential food shortages”.<br/><br/>According to the Myanmar Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan 2024, even before the flooding, 1.5 million people in Ayeyarwady required humanitarian assistance – one in four of the population.<br/><br/>The UN aid office OCHA which issued the grim country assessment last December noted that than 18.6 million people were estimated to be in humanitarian need. “Children are bearing the brunt of the crisis with six million children in need as a result of displacement, interrupted healthcare and education, food insecurity and malnutrition, and protection risks including forced recruitment and mental distress,” it said.<br/><br/>Rare intervention<br/><br/>The WFP aid operation marks its first intervention in the delta in nine years; the UN agency last provided assistance in 2015 following widespread flooding.<br/><br/>It has also supported assistance so far to 130,000 people in flood-affected communities across Myanmar in Bago, Kachin, Kayin, Magway, Mandalay, and Sagaing. “WFP is assessing the needs in Rakhine and stands ready to respond,” it noted in a press release.<br/><br/>The UN agency’s flood response includes areas that have been affected by conflict, except for Ayeyarwady and parts of Bago, which are among the only few regions in Myanmar where there is no fighting.</p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/08/1153546'>https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/08/1153546</a></p>",

More than 99 percent of humanity is now breathing polluted air, leading to more than 8 million annual deaths, including more than 700,000 children under five.<br/><br/>Dirty air disproportionately affects more vulnerable populations such as women, children and older people. Air pollution has become the second leading risk factor for early death globally, overtaking tobacco for adults and second only to malnutrition for children under five. Yet despite already high and still rising economic, environmental and existential impact of air pollution, which each year costs the world USD $ 8.1 trillionin health damages alone, less than 1 per cent of international development funding is dedicated to tackling it.<br/><br/>In addition to this silent killer’s toll on human health, “pollution is also choking economies and heating up our planet, adding fuel to the fire of the climate crisis,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in his message for the day, which the UN General Assembly designated as a day to champion clean air causes in 2019.<br/><br/>Led by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), this year’s theme focuses on amplifying global calls to Invest in #CleanAirNow to ensure a healthier and more prosperous future for people and the planet.<br/><br/>“Investing in clean air requires actions by both government and businesses to phase out fossil fuels, strengthen air quality monitoring, enforce air quality standards, boost renewable energy, transition to clean cooking, build sustainable transport and sustainable waste management systems, clean up supply chains, and reduce harmful emissions, including methane,” the UN Secretary-General said.<br/><br/>Ahead of Clean Air Day, the UNEP-convened Climate and Clean Air Coalition(CCAC) launched AQMx, a global air quality management platform, on 5 September in response to calls from countries for greater regional knowledge sharing and action on improving air quality that led to a resolution at this year’s UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-6) talks.<br/><br/>UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen used her Clean Air Day messageto call for greater investment in air pollution solutions in all societies, and an end to the violation of every human being’s fundamental right to breathe clean air.<br/><br/>“We are asking nations, regions and cities to establish robust air quality standards by backing renewable energy and sustainable transport, holding industry to account with strict emission standards, and integrating air quality into climate action,” she said.<br/><br/>“We are asking for strong funding through redirecting fossil fuel subsidies, through grants or microloans for cleaner cooking technologies, and through serious private sector engagement and investment,” she added. “We are asking for collective action, from international development initiatives to individuals that can make small changes in their own lifestyles.”<br/><br/>Events across the world marked the International Day of Clean Air for blue skies: South Africa held a two-day conference, and UNEP supported a webinar to highlight how African cities can avoid open burning of waste. There were high-level discussions in Asia featuring youth voices from across the continent, and a celebration on the site of a former steel mill in Beijing that was transformed into an outdoor Olympic Games area to tackle air pollution. In Latin America, UNEP and Wikimedia held an editing workshop to improve public information on air pollution, and in North America, the CCAC, UNEP and the World Resources Institute hosted a Clean Air Day event that featured speakers from NASA, the U.S. and U.K. governments, and the World Bank.<br/><br/>The good news is that air pollution is preventable, and people around the world are stepping up to address the crisis. Proving that change is possible, some cities have slashed air pollution levels, while countries have committed to reducing methane – a potent air pollutant also driving global warming – through the Global Methane Pledge and developed integrated plans to comprehensively tackle air pollution. A 20 per cent decrease in just one common pollutant, PM2.5, could lead to a 16 per cent jump in employment growth and 33 per cent jump in productivity, while reducing methane emissions could save between USD $4 billion and USD $33 billion by halving crop losses by 2050. Cutting super pollutants could further limit temperature rise and protect food security by preventing up to 0.5°C of warming by 2050.<br/><br/>To limit harm from unclean air, Governments can, among other measures, set and implement stricter air quality standards, invest in air quality monitoring to identify and track pollution hotspots, build institutional capacity to address air pollution, and integrate clean air measures into national policies and plans. Businesses should invest in clean technologies and practices that reduce emissions and assess their air pollution footprint and make clean air a core aspect of their business planning.<br/><br/>Air pollution knows no borders, and everyone has a duty to protect our atmosphere and a right to inhale healthy air. By working across all regions, sectors, and societies, and investing in cleaning up our air we can collectively breathe easier for generations to come.</p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/clean-air-day-highlights-urgent-need-invest-air-pollution-solutions'>https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/clean-air-day-highlights-urgent-need-invest-air-pollution-solutions</a></p>",

Comprising of 26 corporate members with a collective market value of US $893 billion, OP2B has worked since its launch in 2019 to incentivize regenerative agriculture, a holistic approach to transform agricultural models, taking environmental and socioeconomic dimensions into account.<br/><br/>Regenerative agriculture is absolutely critical to transforming the food system. We must put farmers at the center of everything we do, adapting to the diverse realities of the geographies where we operate, while embracing technology and fostering innovative public-private mechanisms to accelerate the change. In doing so, we are creating a model which is actually more economically sustainable for the farmers.<br/><br/>- Antoine de Saint-Affrique, Danone CEO and OP2B Co-Chair<br/><br/>Collaboration is key to transforming our agricultural systems. Regenerative agriculture offers a solution to the growing challenges farmers and businesses face, but we need coordinated action across the value chain to make it a reality. At OP2B, we are focused on lifting the barriers to accelerate the transition to regenerative agriculture. This is the path for a regenerative and equitable agricultural system producing quality raw material and nutritious food for all.<br/><br/>– Peter Bakker, President and CEO, World Business Council for Sustainable Development and OP2B Co-Chair<br/><br/>With only 5 harvests left until 2030, there is an urgent need to accelerate the scale-up from pilots to large-scale landscapes transformations to stay within planetary boundaries. By collectively investing in regenerative agriculture, we can contribute to a net-zero, climate-resilient, nature positive and equitable agricultural system. We call upon financial actors, businesses and policymakers to unite in supporting farmers to transition to regenerative agricultural practices.<br/><br/>– Stefania Avanzini, Director OP2B<br/><br/>The five-year progress report released today, “OP2B Five-Year Report: Demonstrating progress on regenerative agriculture,” examines efforts by 19 value chain actors of the 26 OP2B members. According to the report, investments in transition finance for regenerative agriculture totaled US $3.6 billion between 2019 and 2023. The coalition aims to impact over 12 million hectares of land, equivalent to over 29 million acres, by 2030.<br/><br/>The transition to regenerative agriculture will require continued partnership and investment across the value chain to deliver impact at scale and speed to future proof our global food systems. That’s why we are proud to be founding members of OP2B which enables the acceleration of collaboration across industries to drive change and ultimately support farming partners on this journey to greater resilience.<br/><br/>- Max Koeune, CEO of McCain Foods and OP2B board member<br/><br/>With the increasing frequency of extreme weather events (such as droughts, flooding and extreme heat), combined with the immense loss of biodiversity due to agriculture over the past several decades, regenerative farming practices can be a powerful tool for farmers to adapt to a changing climate and increase profitability. Regenerative farming holds a positive business case for farmers, increasing farm profitability and the resilience of farming communities. It can restore degraded agricultural soils and positively impact climate, biodiversity and water.<br/><br/>It is crucial that food and beverage companies focus on collaborative action with farmers to help regenerative agricultural practices become the norm around the world. We need to help standardize, simplify and de-risk this transition for farmers and build resiliency across all our supply chains. At Diageo, we see OP2B as a key partner in driving more effective and efficient scaling of regenerative agriculture.<br/><br/>- Ewan Andrew, President, Global Supply Chain & Procurement and Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), Diageo<br/><br/>I’m seeing firsthand the opportunities to use regenerative agriculture practices to be more profitable and resilient. We’ve shown the world that not only is regenerative agriculture better for ecosystem management and resiliency in a changing climate, but it actually is far more profitable than standard farming practices.<br/><br/>- Meghap Sapp, farmer and one of the founders of the European Alliance for Regenerative Agriculture (EARA). EARA is a key stakeholder and Advocacy partner of OP2B<br/><br/>The potential for transformation remains largely untapped, with a funding gap of more than US $300 billion annually. By committing to regenerative agriculture, businesses can lead the way in cultivating a resilient net-zero agricultural system while benefiting biodiversity, economy and rural communities worldwide.<br/><br/>Scaling up regenerative agriculture is one of the most critical initiatives for Nestlé, the agriculture and food industry because it contributes to securing food for the future. Regenerative agriculture has proven to help farms to be more resilient against extreme weather conditions.<br/><br/>- Antonia Wanner, Group Head of ESG Strategy and Deployment, Nestlé<br/><br/>Regenerative agriculture is a critical solution to transform the way we produce food, feed and fiber, benefiting the climate, nature and people. Over the next few years, the OP2B coalition will focus on unlocking three strategic levers to scale up regenerative agriculture: harmonizing measurement, fostering collaborations to support farmers’ transition, and advocating for policies that create an enabling environment.<br/><br/>Main conclusions from the progress report:<br/><br/>• Nearly 60% of OP2B companies initiated a total number of 72 programs related to regenerative agriculture before 2022, involving 300,000 farmers. As a result, farmers cite tangible benefits from regenerative systems: healthier soil, reduced input costs, fewer complications from fertilizer run-off, greater biodiversity and better resilience to extreme climate.<br/><br/>• Investment in financing the transition to regenerative agriculture is a critical area where strides are being made. Between 2019 and 2023, investments in transition finance for regenerative finance totaled US $3.6 billion. Some 47% of OP2B members are both actively financing regenerative agriculture and disclosing the committed amount. This indicates dedication to the agricultural transition and support for farming communities. It also paves the way for other organizations to follow their lead.<br/><br/>Examples of collective actions taken by OP2B members<br/><br/>The OP2B coalition is accelerating action to transition to regenerative agricultural practices at the landscape level. OP2B member companies reported on 72 programs across their supply chains , working with farmers on the transition to regenerative agriculture. Since its inception, OP2B has been collecting insights from its members’ actions to support change in agricultural practices on the ground and across their supply chains. The key findings underlying the drivers of success (people, place, money, time and governance) point to the opportunities that are enabled through collective action. Below you will find examples of collaborative actions and here is the link to our blog series featuring impact stories from member companies.<br/><br/>Kering, L’Occitane and Mirova<br/><br/>One of the signature collaborative initiatives undertaken by OP2B members is the Climate Fund for Nature, initiated by Kering, supported by L’Occitane Group and managed by Mirova. The fund, launched in 2022, mobilizes resources from the luxury, fashion and beauty sectors to protect and restore nature, with a particular focus on female empowerment. There is already €140 million committed out of a €300 million target size.<br/><br/>We depend on nature and must take responsibility as its stewards, both individually and collectively. Together, we are leading the transition from conventional practices to sustainable farming models that restore and give back to nature. It’s not just about preserving our resources but also about securing the future viability of our entire ecosystem.<br/><br/>– Adrien Geiger, CEO L'OCCITANE en Provence<br/><br/>Kering, Inditex and Conservation International<br/><br/>Kering and Conservation International launched the Regenerative Fund for Nature in 2021, with Inditex joining in 2023 and injecting €15 million, to support innovative agricultural practices and transform the supply chains that provide the raw materials for fashion. The fund aims to transform 1 million hectares (2.5 million acres) of farms and rangeland in fashion’s supply chains to regenerative agriculture spaces by 2026.<br/><br/>PepsiCo and Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)<br/><br/>A multi-year shared value partnership between PepsiCo and ADM to reduce carbon intensity by expanding regenerative practices on up to two million acres across their shared supply chains. The project aims to support farmers across the Midwest U.S. in building resilience to climate change and has the potential to eliminate over 1.4 million metric tons of GHG emissions.<br/><br/>Farmers are critical to our business. We envision a world where food is grown in a way that revitalizes the earth, supports farmer livelihoods, feeds a growing population and innovates how ingredients are grown. PepsiCo aspires to protect biodiversity, all while seeking to support a positive future for farmers, communities and our planet. By joining forces with different partners across the value chain, including several OP2B members, we aim to empower farming communities through education, upfront investment in outcomes, peer coaching and cost-sharing – and hopefully inspire others to join the effort.<br/><br/>- Jim Andrew, EVP, Chief Sustainability Officer for PepsiCo<br/><br/>Danone, Mars and Livelihoods Funds<br/><br/>A separate OP2B member initiative, the Livelihoods Fund for Family Farming (L3F), in collaboration with Mars and OP2B member Danone, provides a new approach to transform design and investments in companies’ agricultural supply chains while improving the lives of vulnerable smallholder farmers, addressing social and environmental issues simultaneously. The fund has an investment target of €85 million over 10 years and was launched in 2015.<br/><br/>McCain, L’Occitane, Danone and Livelihoods Funds<br/><br/>OP2B members McCain, Danone and L’Occitane Group joined The Livelihoods Carbon Funds (comprised of three funds), an innovative and replicable investment model that invests in community-based solutions to restore natural ecosystems, and establish agroforestry and regenerative agriculture systems in developing countries that will generate certified carbon offsets. The first fund, launched in 2011, has invested €40 million. The second and third funds, launched in 2017 and 2021 have an investment target of €100 million and €150 million respectively.<br/><br/>Nestlé, McCain and Earthworm<br/><br/>Nestlé and Mc Cain joined Earthworm and other companies in the Living Soils collective program to connect different supply chain nodes to scale up soil restoration and develop  innovative incentives to transform agricultural practices. The program has, to date, engaged 500 farmers and 27 cooperatives and continues to onboard brands and cooperatives /traders and farmers, in different French regions.  The program’s objective is to reach 20,000 farmers by 2030.<br/><br/>MEDIA CONTACT:<br/><br/>Alex Frank, (703) 276-3264, afrank@hastingsgroupmedia.com.<br/><br/>EDITOR’S NOTE:  For publishing rights to graphics, images, and other content featured in the report, contact Alex Frank, (703) 276-3264 or afrank@hastingsgroupmedia.com.<br/><br/>Additional resources:<br/><br/>OP2B 5-year progress report: Demonstrating progress on regenerative agriculture OP2B video: Shaping the future of agriculture: our collective path toward regeneration Example of impact for farmers: InVivo: innovating for sustainable agriculture in France Example of impact for farmers: Nestlé: transforming coffee farming in Vietnam<br/><br/>About OP2B<br/><br/>One Planet Business for Biodiversity (OP2B) is an international cross-sectorial, action-oriented business coalition on biodiversity with a specific focus on agriculture.

The selected projects are expected to work on green and sustainable solutions and to channel actions to prevent and minimize harm from chemicals and waste in some of the world’s most disadvantaged countries.<br/><br/>“Pollution and waste constitute a daily crisis for people’s health, undermine economic activity, and leave nature permanently scarred,” said Sheila Aggarwal-Khan Director of the UNEP Industry and Economy Division. “Today the historic Framework is turning from text into practice and providing concrete benefits for those at the frontlines of this crisis.”<br/><br/>At the Fifth International Conference on Chemicals Management, held in September 2023 in Bonn, delegates from around the world representing governments, private sector, civil society, academia and youth adopted the Framework.  During the conference this dedicated trust fund was set up to support low-and middle-income countries, including small island developing states, in addressing chemicals, including products and waste in line with international standards.<br/><br/>Selected projects will receive 300,000 to 800,000 USD for up to three years to support transformative change to prevent and minimize harm from chemicals and waste and to protect the environment and human health, including vulnerable groups and workers. Such projects will need to have co-financing and in-kind contributions of at least 25 per cent. Governments can apply for funding as well as civil society networks, subject to an agreement with the respective government.<br/><br/>The fund is aiming for medium-scale projects that strengthen national and regional capacities on chemicals and waste management, support the national policies and regulations, advance solutions along the value chain, and work with ministries, regional centres, health networks, major industry sectors, investment and development banks, small businesses, as well as civil society. Priority will be given to projects that ensure their long-term sustainability beyond the Fund’s three-year funding.<br/><br/>The Framework outlines a set of 28 targets to address chemicals, including the prevention of illegal trade and trafficking of chemicals and waste, the implementation of national legal frameworks, the alignment of financial flows, the phase out of highly hazardous pesticides in agriculture by 2035, the transition to safer and more sustainable chemical alternatives and greater transparency and access to information regarding chemicals and their associated risks.<br/><br/>The fund – which complements existing financial mechanisms, including those designed to tackle the two other planetary threats of climate change and biodiversity loss – has received initial support of around 27 million USD, primarily from Germany, as well as the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the International Council of Chemical Associations. Applicants will be able to learn more in a series of webinars on the Fund, its priorities, and on how to apply.<br/><br/>NOTES TO EDITORS<br/><br/>About the Global Framework on Chemicals<br/><br/>The Global Framework on Chemicals is humanity’s blueprint for a planet free of harm from chemicals and waste. This multi-sectoral agreement focuses on chemicals and waste and calls for the prevention of illegal trade, the strengthening of national legal frameworks, the elimination of highly hazardous pesticides in agriculture by 2035, the alignment of financial flows and the need to work with supply chain actors.<br/><br/>About the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)<br/><br/>UNEP is the leading global voice on the environment. It provides leadership and encourages partnership in caring for the environment by inspiring, informing and enabling nations and peoples to improve their quality of life without compromising that of future generations.<br/><br/>For more information, please contact:<br/><br/>News and Media Unit, UN Environment Programme</p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/new-fund-support-chemicals-and-waste-management-developing-economies'>https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/new-fund-support-chemicals-and-waste-management-developing-economies</a></p>",

Harold Pauwels, GRI’s Director of Standards, led discussions on GRI’s upcoming Climate Change and Energy Standards. Reflecting on progress since COP28, In this Medium article he highlights what's to come:<br/><br/>Between two COPs: fresh perspectives on climate action from NYC<br/><br/>COP28 in Dubai saw major climate pledges, including $57 billion in commitments and the launch of the Loss and Damage Fund. However, adaptation funding fell short. As we look to COP29 in Baku, finance alone isn’t enough. Nations must commit to transparent, ambitious climate plans.<br/><br/>During Climate Week, GRI emphasized how private sector accountability can bridge the gap. Two new standards under development on climate change and energy will prioritize reporting that addresses emissions reduction, renewable energy, and a just transition approach.<br/><br/>“Increased corporate transparency and stronger accountability are essential parts of this complex equation. But it’s not just about the environment – it’s about inclusivity. COP29 must bring diverse stakeholders to the table, ensuring that all voices are heard and driving equitable solutions that leave no one behind.”<br/><br/>-Harold Pauwels, Director of Standards at GRI</p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.globalreporting.org/news/news-center/momentum-building-on-climate-finance-and-climate-action/'>https://www.globalreporting.org/news/news-center/momentum-building-on-climate-finance-and-climate-action/</a></p>",

The first iteration of the summit is being held this week in New Delhi.<br/><br/>This joint initiative by IEC, ISO and ITU advances the UN’s framework for global governance of digital technology and AI, the Global Digital Compact. The Compact, which was adopted last month as part of the “Pact for the Future” by world leaders convening at the 2024 UN Summit of the Future, highlights the need for increased collaboration among standards development organizations in promoting the development and adoption of interoperable AI standards that uphold safety, reliability, sustainability and human rights.<br/><br/>The launch of the International AI Standards Summit is a tangible example of the strength of collaboration between the three organizations, and directly answers the call to action for an AI summit outlined in the UN’s recently published High-level Advisory Body report, ‘Governing AI for Humanity’.<br/><br/>As underscored by the UN, AI is already transforming our world, and while it offers tremendous potential for good, if left ungoverned, potential opportunities may not manifest or be distributed equitably.<br/><br/>The International AI Standards Summit aligns with this vision and will serve as a vital platform to address the complex challenges posed by AI, ensuring that standards are developed and remain relevant to foster safe, transparent, and inclusive technologies for all.<br/><br/>ISO Secretary-General Sergio Mujica said there is a critical need for a collaborative approach to effective AI governance through International Standards.<br/><br/>“The adoption of International Standards in a coordinated way is instrumental in ensuring a future of responsible use of AI,” Mr Mujica said.<br/><br/>“AI is revolutionizing industries, driving innovation, and building the resilient infrastructure needed to achieve sustainable development all over the world.<br/><br/>“International Standards lay at the heart of this transformation, helping to ensure that AI is developed, deployed and used in a responsible manner across the globe.<br/><br/>“ISO is committed to developing standards that advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Our ongoing cooperation with IEC and ITU reinforces this mission, including initiatives like the AI and Multimedia Authenticity Standards Collaboration, which we announced in May.<br/><br/>“Standards can support policy goals where global governance is essential, promoting the dissemination of beneficial systems and practices and fostering the efficient development of advanced AI technologies.”<br/><br/>By bringing together key stakeholders and experts from around the world, the summit will build a strong foundation for AI governance, advancing the work on creating global standards that promote inclusive and responsible AI development. The 2025 International AI Standards Summit will take place from 2-3 December 2025 in Seoul, hosted by the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards (KATS).<br/><br/>“We have a responsibility to deliver standards that build confidence in the digital world that underpins so much of our society. Our joint standardization work is already bringing benefits in terms of enhanced interoperability, trustworthiness and transparency in emerging technologies like AI. By working together, IEC, ISO and ITU can leverage their unique expertise and provide valuable insights on AI standards to help governments and policymakers make more informed governance decisions.” said Philippe Metzger, IEC Secretary-General & CEO.<br/><br/>“As three organizations who are committed to delivering on the call in the recent Global Digital Compact, we are pleased to launch the AI Standards Summit. We believe this will enable tangible, and concrete outcomes to further AI innovation in a way that serves the best interests for humanity,” he added.<br/><br/>Seizo Onoe, Director of the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Bureau, reiterated the importance of the partnership:<br/><br/>“ITU is proud to host the first edition of the International AI Standards Summit this week in New Delhi together with our longstanding partners IEC and ISO. We are committed to ensuring that standards support responsible AI governance. That is also the aim of our standards collaboration on AI watermarking and multimedia authenticity launched at this year’s AI for Good Global Summit. IEC, ISO and ITU are now collaborating to develop an AI standards database, a key priority for the UN Secretary-General’s Envoy on Technology.“<br/><br/>The launch of the 2025 International AI Standards Summit on World Standards Day is significant. World Standards Day 2024 encourages the building of a world where resilient infrastructure, sustainable industrial growth, and cutting-edge innovation – powered by AI and supported by International Standards – can drive economic transformation, today and for future generations.<br/><br/>More information about World Standards Day is available at www.worldstandardsday.org<br/><br/></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.iso.org/news/2024/10/2025-international-AI-Standards-Summit'>https://www.iso.org/news/2024/10/2025-international-AI-Standards-Summit</a></p>",

Featuring perspectives and practical advice from fellow practitioners who are actively navigating the transitions in reporting, the report includes strategic discussions with a focus on how to conduct a double materiality assessment, integrate sustainability into governance, activate report content for diverse audiences, and use the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in a meaningful way. Finally, the report also signposts leading practice and useful resources across all aspects of effective reporting.<br/><br/>The pace of change in the sustainability reporting landscape is unprecedented, and companies are rethinking their strategies and structures to meet these new demands. With this edition, we aim to reflect on what companies are doing to manage the transition to more robust, meaningful, and impactful reporting, and on how Reporting matters can evolve to respond to those needs.<br/><br/>-John Revess, Vice President Business Engagement at WBCSD<br/><br/>Key insights from Reporting matters 2024 include:<br/><br/>Materiality: 77% of reviewed reports disclose a double materiality process, up from 55% in 2023. This significant shift reflects the growing importance of assessing both financial and non-financial impacts on society and the environment. Additionally, over half of the companies demonstrate a regular cadence in conducting their materiality assessments, with a smaller group (9%) adopting a dynamic approach that provides insights into how material topics evolve over time.<br/><br/>Sustainability governance: Reporting on executive compensation linked to sustainability performance increased, with 73% of reports disclosing relevant metrics.<br/><br/>Frameworks and standards: There is an upward trend in the number of reports referencing key frameworks and standards, such as the <IR> Framework, SASB and TCFD, and most notably mentions of nature-related frameworks and standards more than doubled for TNFD (from 22% to 52%) and SBTN (from 14% to 30%). <br/><br/>External assurance: 90% of reports included external assurance, with an increase in reasonable assurance of key sustainability performance indicators.<br/><br/>Good practice examples: This edition includes 35 good practice examples covering the full spectrum of the assessment framework and highlighting how companies from diverse sectors and geographies are adapting their reporting approaches in light of emerging requirements and evolving expectations.<br/><br/>Companies are not just preparing to comply with evolving standards but are also striving to lead on transparency and impact. This edition takes stock of how businesses are delivering tangible impact while navigating the complexities of regulatory changes.<br/><br/>-Louise Ayling, Director of Sustainability at Radley Yeldar<br/><br/>Quality and usefulness of disclosures remain in the hands of preparers, from their materiality assessment to how they integrate reporting into business activities and practices.<br/><br/>-Simon Rawson, Deputy Chief Executive at ShareAction<br/><br/>Rising expectations and evolving reporting requirements present near-term challenges worth rising to as we increasingly experience the impacts of a changing world. This requires an enterprise-wide approach across value chains for the integration of sustainability into the heart of business strategy to drive resilience and realize strategic competitive advantage.<br/><br/>-Fiona Watson, Senior Director, Corporate Performance & Accountability at WBCSD<br/><br/>Top reporters<br/><br/>This year, Reporting matters recognizes 14 global companies whose reports reflect exceptional efforts and dedication to reporting, exemplify transparency and are focused on impact.<br/><br/></p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20241127_m_en/2.png' style='width: 100%;' /></p><p>Reporting matters Advisory Group<br/><br/>For the first time this year, WBCSD established an Advisory Group including seven WBCSD member companies (Arçelik (now Beko), CLP Group, dsm-firmenich, EDP, Ingka Group (IKEA Retail), Sumitomo Forestry, and Vale International) representing diverse sectors and geographies, to draw on their expertise and reporting experiences in shaping the content of the publication.

    "news_content": "<p>Press release 7 November 2024<br/><br/>A significant gap in policy ambition exists between globally agreed temperature goals and the emissions reductions of national climate targets, according to a new report on countries covered by the OECD’s International Programme for Action on Climate (IPAC).<br/><br/>According to the 4th edition of the Climate Action Monitor, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) currently commit to a collective reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of only 14% by 2030, compared to 2022 levels, in countries covered by IPAC which produce over 80% of global GHG emissions. This is well short of the estimated 43% global emission reduction needed to limit global warming to 1.5° Paris Agreement goal according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).</p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20241127_m_en/3.png' style='width: 100%;'/>Source: OECD (2024) “Climate Action Monitor” and UNEP 2024 Emission Gap Report</p><p>The report also points to the risk that net-zero targets may not be fulfilled, noting that most current commitments lack a legal basis on which to be enforced. As of August 2024, 110 countries have pledged a net-zero target for 2050 and beyond, covering about 88% of global GHG emissions. However, only 27 countries and the EU, representing 16% of global GHG emissions, have enshrined these targets into law.<br/><br/>“Our 2024 Climate Action Monitor underscores the growing impact of climate-related hazards and confirms that countries' emission reduction pledges are not consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goals,” OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said. “Making real progress on the net-zero transition requires more ambitious mitigation targets and effective implementation”.<br/><br/>The report also highlights the recent slowdown in countries’ climate policy action across the countries that produce nearly two thirds of total greenhouse gas emissions. Based on the Climate Actions and Policies Measurement Framework (CAPMF), which tracks both the number of adopted national climate policies and their stringency, national climate mitigation action only expanded by 1% and 2% in 2022 and 2023 respectively, compared to an average of 10% per year between 2010-21. This trend suggests that there could be a significant implementation gap where even the current modest GHG emissions reduction targets may not be achieved by 2030.<br/><br/>With 2024 on track to set new records for global warming, the detrimental effects of rising temperatures, changing rain patterns and other climate-related hazards are being seen on food systems, with croplands increasingly exposed to agricultural droughts. Many countries have observed a notable decline in soil moisture levels on croplands during 2019-23 when compared to the reference period of 1981-2010, highlighting the urgent need for adaptation strategies to enhance resilience in farming practices. Heatwaves, wildfires, floods, and hurricanes have raged across the globe, destroying lives and livelihoods and the population exposed to extreme temperatures is growing rapidly. During the same period, the countries covered in the report experienced on average an additional 30 days of above-average temperatures compared to the baseline period.<br/><br/>Note to Editors:<br/><br/>The fourth edition of the Climate Action Monitor is a deliverable of the Net Zero+ International Programme for Action on Climate (IPAC), which provides foundational data and metrics to assess country progress towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and the Paris Agreement goals. IPAC examines key trends and developments while assessing the progress of countries’ climate policies, complementing and supporting the monitoring frameworks of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement.<br/><br/>IPAC data underpins numerous climate initiatives at the OECD, including the Inclusive Forum on Carbon Mitigation Approaches. Making progress towards the net-zero challenge not only demands ambitious mitigation targets and effective implementation, but also dealing with the barriers and opportunities presented by the policy landscape and ensuring that the transition is resilient to changing circumstances.<br/><br/>IPAC covers the following countries: all OECD countries, OECD partner countries (Brazil, People’s Republic of China, India, Indonesia, South Africa), prospective members (Argentina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Peru, Romania), Saudi Arabia, Malta and the EU.<br/><br/>Countries that have enshrined net-zero targets in law: Australia, Austria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Maldives, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the EU.<br/><br/>The Climate Actions and Policies Measurement Framework (CAPMF) is a climate mitigation database developed by the OECD that measures governments’ climate policy action both in terms of policy adoption and stringency. It consistently tracks 56 key climate policies based on 130 policy variables from 1990 to 2023 for all OECD and OECD partners countries except the United States, which jointly account for nearly two thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions.<br/><br/>The Climate Action Monitor is being presented during a session at the OECD COP 29 Virtual Pavilion taking place on 7 November at 16:00-17:30 CET.<br/><br/>For further information on OECD climate change work, contact the OECD Media Office (+33 1 45 24 97 00).<br/><br/>Working with over 100 countries, the OECD is a global policy forum that promotes policies to preserve individual liberty and improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.<br/><br/></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2024/11/progress-in-national-climate-policy-efforts-remains-insufficient-to-achieve-2030-targets.html'>https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2024/11/progress-in-national-climate-policy-efforts-remains-insufficient-to-achieve-2030-targets.html</a></p>",

    "news_summary": "",
    "image_path": "",
    "news_content": "<p>21 Nov 2024 / Story / Fresh water<br/><br/>Water is the lifeblood of our planet and freshwater ecosystems play a key role in sopping up planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions and making our societies resilient to climate disasters. But the delicate balance of water availability and the habitats that keep it clean and supply it are under mounting pressure from climate change and often receive short shrift during international climate talks.<br/><br/>That is poised to change this week at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29). On 21 November, COP29 Presidency Azerbaijan will launch the Baku Dialogue on Water for Climate Action, a formal series of discussions to be held each year during the UN climate summit, developed with support from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the UN Economic Commission for Europe and the World Meteorological Organization. These dialogues will bring together governments, businesses and other groups to ensure that water remains central to negotiations on climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.<br/><br/>We recently spoke with Susan Gardner, Director of UNEP’s Ecosystems Division, about the declaration of the Baku Water for Climate Action Dialogue and how action on water and freshwater ecosystems can help keep alive the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.<br/><br/>What is the state of the world’s freshwater resources?<br/><br/>Susan Garder (SG): In many places, not good. A recent report from UNEP found that half of the world’s countries have degraded freshwater systems and that 400-plus river basins globally are seeing flows decline, including iconic watersheds, like the Congo Basin. The World Meteorological Organization also notes that 2023 marked the driest year in over three decades for rivers around the world.<br/><br/>As climate change accelerates, the planet’s hydrological cycle has become unpredictable and countries are increasingly faced with too much or too little water, or often too polluted water.<br/><br/>What is the decline of freshwater resources and climate change doing to people?<br/><br/>SG: We are facing what experts call a water crisis. At least 50 per cent of the planet’s population – 4 billion people – deal with water shortfalls at least one month of the year. More than 2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water, a human right, and by 2025, 1.8 billion people are likely to face “absolute water scarcity.” These water shortages are occurring as a result of population growth, unsustainable water management, poor governance, deteriorating infrastructure, inefficient water use, and increasing competition for water between different sectors.<br/><br/>What’s more is that water is the face of most climate impacts. Intense rains and flood have made headlines all over the world this year. Restoring our balance with water is key to adapt to climate change.<br/><br/>Why is the loss of lakes, rivers, wetlands including peatlands and other freshwater habitats such a big problem when it comes to climate change and what are some solutions that can be scaled?<br/><br/>SG: From source to sea, water connects and is part of everything we do, delivering essential ecosystem services including food and water provision and regulation. Take peatlands, for example: they are both land and water at the same time, but it is the water that keeps that ecosystem thriving, storing carbon for generations.<br/><br/>For example, in the Union of the Comoros, UNEP, in partnership with the government, is planting 1.4 million trees and restoring and managing 7,500 hectares of watersheds, enhancing local water supplies, and reducing vulnerability to climate-related hazards.<br/><br/>Alongside the launch of the Baku Dialogue, the COP29 Presidency in consultation with Member States and stakeholders developed the COP29 Declaration on Water for Climate Action, with support from UNECE, UNEP, and WMO which calls upon countries to shield freshwater ecosystems from the impacts of climate change. Why is this particular launch important?<br/><br/>SG: The launch of the Baku Dialogue on Water for Climate Action is an opportunity for countries to come together and support the implementation of ambitious water-related climate policies. The Baku Dialogue on Water especially fills an important gap in international climate negotiations. Action on water is like a missing puzzle piece. Without it, the world will struggle to keep global temperature rise below 1.5°C, a key goal of the Paris Agreement, and realize the Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20241127_m_en/4.png' style='width: 100%;' /></p><p>Is the world making any progress when it comes to protecting water resources?<br/><br/>SG: In some ways, yes. Global political commitments on water have never been higher. Earlier this year at the UN Environment Assembly, the world’s top decision-making body on the environment, countries passed a resolution calling for nations to more sustainably manage freshwater supplies. Last year, also saw the adoption of the Water Action Agenda, in which hundreds of governments, businesses and other groups made water-related promises.<br/><br/>Recent developments like those are encouraging. But in the face of growing climate change, the world needs to do more, do it better and do it faster.<br/><br/>With COP29 wrapping up this week, what do countries need to do next?<br/><br/>SG: To tackle the global water crisis, nations need to start treating water like the common good that it is. They would be well served to reorient public policies, like water prices, agricultural subsidies and procurement rules, so that they encourage water conservation, especially among the most prolific users of water.<br/><br/>While nations do this, it is essential to ensure our most vulnerable communities have access to clean water and sanitation.<br/><br/>Managing water demand more effectively and equitably, and improving cost recovery, would help bolster investments in water and water-related infrastructure.<br/><br/>In short, there is a lot that countries can do. But the time to do it is running out. Financial support from countries and backing from financial institutions is key to make significant progress quickly.<br/><br/>###<br/><br/>UN Climate Change Conference<br/><br/>The 29th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29) will be held in Baku, Azerbaijan from 11 to 22 November. It aims to drive action on climate change by reducing emissions and halting global warming. You can follow live COP29 updates on  UNEP’s climate action feed.<br/><br/>COP29 Declaration on Water for Climate Action<br/><br/>The COP29 Azerbaijan Presidency has put forward the COP29 Declaration on Water for Climate Action. The declaration will launch the Baku Dialogue on Water for Climate Action to serve as a COP-to-COP collaboration platform fostering continuity and coherence, ensuring a consistent focus on water and its interplay with climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and desertification.<br/><br/>As the host for the Baku Dialogue, UNEP is working to scale up effective and inclusive solutions, supporting Member States to strengthen their national and subnational water policies, sectoral integration, upgrading of data and information, curating targeted knowledge exchange and best practice from around the world critical to accelerate water for climate action.<br/><br/></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/water-spotlight-un-climate-summit-heres-why-matters'>https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/water-spotlight-un-climate-summit-heres-why-matters</a></p>",

It is an insult. It is shocking that we are at this state now. The rich countries are basically gambling with the lives of people in the developing nations and small islands,” she said.<br/><br/>Lidy Nacpil from Asian Peoples’ Movement on Debt and Development also expressed her disappointment. She also pointed out that “climate finance should not come in the form of loans because this will add to the debt burden”.<br/><br/>“One of the issues that is preventing the Global South from undertaking urgent climate actions and also from providing our people with the essential services we need is the debt burden,” she told UN News.<br/><br/>Jacobo Ocharan of Climate Action Network International said: “We urge all developing countries to have the courage in the negotiations to keep pushing, because this deal is terrible. We keep pushing on the idea that no deal is better than a bad deal.”<br/><br/></p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20241127_m_en/6.jpg' style='width: 100%;' />UNFCCC/Kiara Worth / Negotiating teams at COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, pictured here during a break in the talks, are working to reach agreement on a new climate financing deal.</p><p>What’s at stake<br/><br/>COP29, formally the 29th Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), has been dubbed, the ‘climate finance COP’ because parties are expected to establish a new global climate finance target.<br/><br/>This target, or new collective quantified goal (NCQG), is seen as one of the summit's main deliverables. It will replace the existing $100 billion goal that is due to expire in 2025.<br/><br/>Climate experts have pegged the new annual funding goal at between $1 trillion and $1.3 trillion, which would assist vulnerable nations to deal with loss and damage from climate change and to adapt to that change, including building out their own clean-energy systems.<br/><br/>Last week, in a move to support a new funding target, the World Bank Group and other multilateral development banks announced a significant boost in climate finance for low- and middle- income countries. This would reach $120 billion a year by 2030 with another $65 billion mobilised from the private sector, and a natural projection that would increase these values for 2035.<br/><br/>A significant breakthrough on the opening day at COP29 was the adoption of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, paving the way for a UN-backed global carbon market. This market will facilitate the trading of carbon credits, incentivizing countries to reduce emissions and invest in climate-friendly projects.</p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157346'>https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157346</a></p>",

It revealed that GRI usage has risen to 71% (up three percentage points on 2022), while among a subset of the 250 largest multinationals (the G250) GRI adoption is steady, at 77%.<br/><br/></p><p>Key findings in the survey include:<br/><ul><li>GRI continues to be the most widely used by companies across all regions: Asia-Pacific (75%), Europe (71%), Americas (70%), and Middle East & Africa (64%). </li><li>The countries with the highest GRI adoption rates by leading companies are Taiwan (100%), Singapore (97%), Spain, Japan and South Korea (all 94%).</li><li>Companies obtaining independent sustainability assurance has risen to 54% in the N100, and 69% of the G250  – reinforcing IFAC analysis that GRI reports are the most frequently assured.</li><li>There is growing application of ‘double materiality’ assessments, now undertaken by half of the G250, indicating an increased understanding of the need to disclose socio-environmental impacts in addition to financial risks and opportunities.</li><li>There are signs of early adoption of the newly available European Sustainability Reporting Standards, and the International Sustainability Standard Board’s IFRS-S2, while voluntary practices led by the GRI Standards remain prevalent.</li></ul></p><p>“It is hugely encouraging that a growing number of leading companies around the world – over 70% – are using the GRI Standards. Sustainability reporting is more relevant than ever. Understanding and disclosing material topics is a crucial step in developing a robust sustainability strategy, informing the wider business strategy and, of course, managing risks and unlocking value. It is also clear that the advent of new regulations and disclosure expectations, which the KPMG survey is starting to reflect, will further mainstream the practice of sustainability reporting. The good news for the thousands of GRI reporting companies is that they are well prepared to also apply other standards, and GRI will help them on their disclosure journey.”<br/><br/>-Cristina Gil White, Interim CEO of GRI<br/><br/>The biannual KPMG research builds on recent analysis from the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) that the GRI usage rate among 1,400 leading companies is 77%, while WBCSD’s Reporting Matters 2024, published on 7 November, found 83% of 181 large companies assessed report with the GRI Standards.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the 2024 ‘Carrots & Sticks’ report, released last week, tracked sustainability and ESG policies set by governments, agencies and other bodies. Of the global total, 18% (477 policies) reference GRI, with six mandating compliance and 127 recommending adoption.<br/><br/>GRI provides training, services and support to help organizations on their sustainability reporting journey. This includes courses on the GRI Academy that address the reporting landscape, such as a new course on completing a double materiality assessment under the ESRS.<br/><br/></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.globalreporting.org/news/news-center/gri-global-adoption-by-top-companies-continues-to-grow/'>https://www.globalreporting.org/news/news-center/gri-global-adoption-by-top-companies-continues-to-grow/</a></p>",

Over the last two years, another 20 members have been accredited to this body. We now stand at 150, which is unequivocal proof of the vibrancy of Nairobi’s multilateral scene. My deep thanks to new and existing members for your engagement and leadership. <br/><br/>I would like to welcome UNEP’s new Director of Corporate Services Division, Ms. Soomi Ro, who joins us today for the first time. Soomi has extensive experience in administration across the UN system. This includes corporate support services, global supply chain management, resource mobilization and much more. <br/><br/>With past postings on the operational front line of peacekeeping, administration and management in New York, and with her last role as Director of Administration at the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, I am very confident that Soomi will continue UNEP’s efforts towards greater efficiency, effectiveness and impact. <br/><br/>My huge thanks go to our Deputy Executive Director, Elizabeth Mrema, who unfortunately cannot join us today, for her work doubling up as the Acting Director of Corporate Services over the last 15 long months. Elizabeth has done an amazing job, despite the heavy demands as Deputy Executive Director. I am immensely grateful for her leadership.<br/><br/>I would also like to congratulate Ulf Björnholm, the Deputy Secretary, on his temporary appointment as the Secretary of the Governing Bodies of UN-Habitat. We wish him the best in his new role and thank him for his contribution to UNEP. <br/><br/>Excellencies, <br/><br/>It has been a hectic period since the last CPR meeting. We saw the Summit of the Future and the general debate of the General Assembly (UNGA), G20 meetings, three gatherings of the Rio Conventions, negotiations on plastic pollution and more. These moments delivered both encouraging successes and some disappointments in global efforts to tackle the three planetary environmental crises – the crisis of climate change, the crisis of nature, biodiversity and land loss, and the crisis of pollution and waste. <br/><br/>The headlines have focused on delays and insufficient progress in some areas, particularly around financing and around ambition. I understand the frustration that many Member States and observers feel. And I share the concerns of citizens across the world over the pace of action. Nonetheless the international community did land certain key decisions amid a turbulent geopolitical background. Decisions which were significant and will help us move forward. <br/><br/>Allow me to review some of these, starting with the Pact for the Future. <br/><br/>The Pact is a milestone in the 79-year history of the United Nations and raises the bar of our collective ambition. In the Pact, Member States commit to modernizing the peace and security agenda. <br/><br/>The Pact speaks to the need to reform the international financial architecture to better serve developing countries as they pursue sustainable development. The Pact emphasizes the need for climate action, including transitioning away from fossil fuels. And the Pact lays out commitments on plastics, chemicals, biodiversity, desertification and the governance of Artificial Intelligence – on which UNEP recently released a well-received Issues Note regarding the environmental impact of this growing technology. <br/><br/>The Pact matters because it sets a new global standard after 79 years. It matters because everything it covers can have a huge positive impact on the environment. We at UNEP are ready to support implementation, and we will seek to reflect relevant elements of the Pact in the new UNEP Medium-Term Strategy. <br/><br/>Also at UNGA, the High-level Meeting on Antimicrobial Resistance released a political declaration that included a commitment to cut 10 per cent off the estimated 4.95 million deaths associated with bacterial antimicrobial resistance each year by 2030. UNEP will continue to play a leading role – with our friends in the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the World Organisation for Animal Health – in the global response to antimicrobial resistance. And we do that through a One Health approach that combines human, animal, plant and environmental health. <br/><br/>There were also significant developments at the Convention on Biological Diversity COP16. <br/><br/>After lengthy discussions, a milestone decision, a massive decision, was reached to give Indigenous Peoples, people of African descent and their communities recognition as rights-holders in biodiversity conservation – thereby creating a subsidiary body for these communities under article 8J of the convention. <br/><br/>Another significant decision was the creation of the Cali Fund. This fund will be composed of contributions from the use of digital sequence information – genetic codes coming from samples of organisms that are often shared digitally. Companies using this information to develop products, such as pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, should allocate part of their earnings to this fund, from which resources will be allocated to communities and Indigenous Peoples, directly or through governments. The aim is to ensure fair and equitable distribution of profits from the use of such information. There is more work to be done in this regard, but it is nonetheless a milestone.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, COP16 ran out of time. Decisions on resource mobilization and monitoring were carried over to the resumed session in Rome, which is scheduled for February. But other progress was made outside of negotiations.<br/><br/>For example, the China-funded Kunming Biodiversity Fund, which provides financial and technical support for the implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), approved its first projects. Also on the sidelines of the COP, UNEP’s World Conservation Monitoring Centre launched the Protected Planet Report, which concludes that 18 per cent of land and inland waters and 8 per cent of ocean and coastal areas are now protected. Yes, work needs to accelerate, but this is tangible progress towards the GBF target to protect 30 per cent of the Earth by 2030.<br/><br/>My congratulations to Colombia for the successful hosting of the COP in a beautiful city that I did not know but have now fallen in love with.<br/><br/>At the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change COP29, a notable achievement was the progress on carbon markets. After nearly a decade of work, countries have agreed on the final building blocks that set out how carbon markets will operate under the Paris Agreement, making country-to-country trading and a carbon crediting mechanism fully operational.<br/><br/>On day one of the COP, countries agreed standards for a centralized carbon market under the UN. This is good news for developing countries, who can now benefit from new flows of finance and receive the capacity-building support they need to get a foothold in the market.<br/><br/>On country-to-country trading, which is also important, the decision out of COP29 provides clarity on how countries will authorize the trade of carbon credits and how registries tracking this will operate. And there is now reassurance that environmental integrity will be ensured up front through transparent technical reviews.<br/><br/>But the central focus of COP29 was on climate finance. Here, the COP did not come up with the number that many had hoped for. However, after a tense finale, Parties agreed to a New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance, which will triple finance to developing countries from the previous goal of US$100 billion to US$300 billion annually by 2035. And Parties agreed to secure the efforts of all actors, public and private, on scaling up finance to developing countries to US$1.3 trillion per year by 2035.<br/><br/>Much remains to be done on climate – a point emphasized by UNEP’s Adaptation and Emissions Gap Reports, which were cited throughout COP29. To stay on track for 1.5°C by 2100, we need to see a 42 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions between now and 2030. That is huge. And in 2023, our emissions went up by 1.3 per cent. So, G20 members, which are together responsible for 77 per cent of global emissions, not counting the African Union, have a significant job to do. <br/><br/>The next round of Nationally Determined Contributions, due by February, will be crucial to closing this gap. All Member States must make a massive stretch in ambition to live up to the 1.5°C promise. We recognize the historical trail of CO2 and the greater responsibility of some, but we are calling for everyone to act, or we will scoot right past 1.5°C. And it does remain mathematically possible to achieve 1.5°C – with rapid and massive investments in solar, wind and forestry, as well as tackling methane, construction and cooling and much more.  <br/><br/>UNEP’s work through the International Methane Emissions Observatory, highlighted at COP29, shows that quick, untapped gains are possible. Over the last few years, the observatory’s satellite system issued 1,200 notifications of major methane leaks. Addressing just two of those leaks helped prevent the release of greenhouse gases equivalent to what one million cars produce annually. With action and attention on sustainable cooling, critical energy transition minerals and private sector finance also growing during COP29, there is hope that the heavy lift ahead can be done.<br/><br/>My deep appreciation to the government of Azerbaijan for also hosting a magnificent and exceptionally well-planned COP in beautiful Baku, another city we have fallen in love with. <br/><br/>Excellencies, in Busan, Republic of Korea, nations made progress toward crafting a global instrument to end plastic pollution. <br/><br/>While the talks were adjourned, the ambition of UNEA Resolution 5/14 does not end. The commitment to creating an instrument that stands the test of time continues. <br/><br/>Some key advances were made during the talks, known as INC-5, with the establishment of a structured framework and articles for a future instrument. This is reflected in the Chair’s Text, which the Committee agreed to use as a foundation for concluding negotiations at the resumed session. <br/><br/>This document finalized 29 out of 32 articles. Brackets remain in three pivotal areas where divergence remains, and where political solutions are required. These areas are products, including the issue of chemicals. Supply, or sustainable production and consumption. And financing, as well as scope.<br/><br/>The differences among Member States are now crystal clear. While complex, these differences are not insurmountable. It is essential for Member States to find ways to resolve these differences before INC-5.2 begins. Continuing to insist on differing positions will not lead to the agreement that the world wants.<br/><br/>It is an undeniable fact that the world has charged this body with finding a way to end plastic pollution. We heard this call loud and clear from the hundreds of observers, and people across the entire UN. We heard businesses calling for global rules. We saw countries agreeing the Pact for the Future with specific backing for a deal to end plastic pollution. <br/><br/>We saw the G20 Leaders Declaration indicating that they are determined to land an ambitious, fair and transparent instrument. Therefore, we at UNEP look forward to supporting Member States in this work as we carry it forward into the resumed session.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, UNEP, the UN Capital Development Fund and the International Finance Corporation are starting a collaboration to facilitate private sector investments in solutions across the life cycle of plastics. We launched that on the sidelines of the Baku COP.<br/><br/>We are all determined to end plastic pollution and commit to working together with the ambition to conclude, before the next UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-7), the negotiation of an ambitious, fair and transparent international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution. I call on all Member States to lean in.<br/><br/>Finally, there was another COP that we must not forget. Just this Saturday morning, the gavel went down on UN Convention to Combat Desertification COP16 in beautiful Riyadh.<br/><br/>The COP saw the launch of the Riyadh Action Agenda. It saw US$12 billion committed in loans and grants for land restoration and drought resilience initiatives. It also launched the Riyadh Global Drought Resilience Partnership, which will work to leverage public and private finance in support of 80 of the most vulnerable and drought-hit countries around the world. This comes in addition to regional initiatives to improve global capacity for forecasting dust and sandstorms and mitigating their impacts. <br/><br/>While the COP did not manage to land an Open-Ended Working Group to negotiate an instrument on drought, it raised the visibility of the land restoration agenda and put a massive spotlight on the issue of drought and the convention itself.<br/><br/>So, again, two beautiful cities, Busan and Riyadh, hosted us marvellously with fantastic arrangements. We are very grateful to both cities.<br/><br/>Excellencies, the last few months have indisputably demonstrated tangible progress, albeit with some disappointments along the way. Next year must bring a further rise in action to build on this progress – through stronger climate pledges, through stronger financing across the three crises, through an agreement on the plastic pollution treaty text and through the completion of negotiations on the science-policy panel on chemicals, waste and pollution. <br/><br/>UNEA-7 will push us forward even faster, and we now have a theme to work towards: Advancing Sustainable Solutions for a Resilient Planet. At UNEA-7, there will be an emphasis on joined-up action across the planetary environmental crises, with a dedicated day on Multilateral Environmental Agreements again taking place. I encourage all Member States to start reflecting on how they will show up at UNEA-7 and the emphasis they want to bring to the table in December next year.<br/><br/>Excellencies,<br/><br/>My thanks go to all Member States that have contributed financially to UNEP’s work. We are very grateful. By the end of November, 89 Member States had contributed just under US$90 million against the approved Environment Fund budget of US$100 million for 2024. Some 55 of these 89 contributors have paid their full share. This is an amazing record. I am in awe of this commitment.<br/><br/>With two weeks left of the year, I encourage every Member State that has not yet contributed to help us close the funding gap. We only need eight more Member States to say that over half of the UN membership has contributed. That would be another breakthrough. I also encourage those that have not yet paid their full share to come in. <br/><br/>I am also pleased to say that the UNEP Planetary Funds – for Climate, Nature and Pollution – have been opening new avenues for financial sustainability. As you will find in the first biennial report on your desks, the US$30 million raised so far has delivered impressive impacts. <br/><br/>My thanks to Belgium, Finland, Norway and the Philippines for their support to the Planetary Funds. And thanks also to the Czech Republic, which has just made a pledge to the Pollution Fund. <br/><br/>I call upon all Member States to consider these funds as an alternative to tightly earmarked funds. Their flexible structure allows UNEP to deliver on its mandate with innovation and future orientation. <br/><br/>I would also like to flag an issue around the seventh Global Environment Outlook, which is due to be launched at UNEA-7. While the Summary for Policy Makers will be made available in all six official UN languages, we would also like to translate the full report into all languages. To do so, we will need extra budgetary or in-kind contributions. I therefore encourage Member States to consider sponsoring this effort. <br/><br/>Finally, please let me draw your attention to a survey that you now have in your inboxes. This online questionnaire from the Joint Inspection Unit is part of a management and administration review of UNEP. Your feedback would be helpful, so pleased do take the time to fill it in. <br/><br/>Excellencies,<br/><br/>Thank you for allowing me the time to share this long but important update, which covers significant milestone events. <br/><br/>As 2024 comes to an end, it is clear the world has moved forward on some key issues and stalled on some others. With the clock ticking down to 2030, with the Sustainable Development Goals and many important deadlines, next year must bring progress across the board, on key issues. A stronger UNEP will do its utmost to help make this happen, and I am sure we can count on you to do the same.<br/><br/></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/speech/three-months-intense-environmental-diplomacy'>https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/speech/three-months-intense-environmental-diplomacy</a></p>",

    "news_summary": "",
    "image_path": "",
    "news_content": "<p>Insurance plays a vital role in managing wildfire risks as climate-related disasters intensify, with wildfires causing rising economic losses and straining insurance markets. Key challenges include affordability, accessibility, and data gaps.<br/><br/>20 January 2025<br/><br/>Leigh WOLFROM <br/>Policy analyst|OECD<br/><br/>The frequency and severity of weather-related hazards including storms, floods and wildfires has increased dramatically in recent years. The devastating wildfires in Southern California which started in early January 2025 are but the latest example, with direct economic losses already estimated at more than USD 60 billion.<br/><br/>By protecting people against the financial impacts of these weather-related hazards, the insurance sector plays a critical role in helping impacted households and businesses recover and rebuild. The pricing that insurance and reinsurance companies apply to coverage can also provide important risk signals and incentives for risk reduction and adaptation.<br/><br/>However, increasing climate-related damages and losses are challenging the ability of insurance companies to offer affordable coverage against weather-related hazards. <br/><br/>Wildfire risks and the insurance sector<br/><br/>The impact of climate change on the sustainability of insurance markets is most visible in the context of wildfire risks. Unlike other natural hazards, coverage for damages and losses from wildfire is almost always included in the property insurance policies required for securing mortgage financing from banks.<br/><br/>Changes in rainfall patterns, temperatures and storm activity, along with significant population growth in the wildland-urban interface have led to an increase in the frequency, size and severity of wildfires in many regions across the world. Average annual economic losses from wildfires more than tripled from USD 2.9 billion in 2000-09 to USD 10.5 billion in 2014-23. <br/><br/></p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20250410_m_en/4.png' style='width: 100%;' /><br/>Source: OECD calculations based on data provided by Swiss Re (Swiss Re, sigma database. All rights reserved.)</p><p>As a relatively high share of wildfire losses are insured (approximately 60% in 2014-23), insurance markets in some highly exposed regions have faced significant stress, including large increases in premium costs and withdrawals of coverage capacity. For many high-risk households and businesses, insurance coverage has become either unaffordable or unavailable.<br/><br/>Building financial resilience to wildfire and other climate risks<br/><br/>Wildfires and other climate-related hazards will become more frequent, destructive, and unpredictable. The growing scale of these disasters requires that policy makers rethink strategies for building financial resilience to climate risks across all segments of society, with a particular focus on investing in risk reduction and adaptation. Investing in risk reduction and adaptation will be the only sustainable means to address the increasing financial costs of these disasters for households, businesses and government at all levels, and maintain the availability of affordable insurance coverage for climate risks.<br/><br/>Insurers are integral to climate and wildfire risk management in two key ways:<br/><br/>1.Risk assessment and mitigation: By analysing data on climate and wildfire risks, insurers  encourage preventive actions through risk-based pricing and premium discounts for mitigation efforts that effectively reduce the impacts of disaster.<br/><br/>2.Financial resilience: Insurance helps communities recover more quickly after disasters, spreading economic losses and reducing reliance on public funds.<br/><br/>The OECD report “Enhancing the Insurance Sector’s Contribution to Climate Adaptation” offers important insights and actionable recommendations for policy makers on how to enhance the insurance sector’s role in supporting risk reduction and adaptation in particular.<br/><br/>Key challenges <br/><br/>Several barriers impede the role of insurance in protecting against climate and wildfire risks:</p><p><ul><li>Affordability and accessibility: As climate and wildfire risks grow, insurance premiums rise, making coverage unaffordable or unavailable for many homeowners and businesses.</li><li>Inadequate risk mitigation: Public and private investments in risk reduction and adaptation often fall short, increasing the impact of storms, floods and wildfires.</li><li>Data gaps: Limited access to accurate, climate-conditioned data on weather-related risks hampers effective investment in risk reduction and adaptation and accurate insurance underwriting and risk assessment.</li></ul></p><p>What can governments do?<br/><br/>To address these challenges, government at local and national level must take decisive action to strengthen the link between insurance and climate resilience:<br/><br/>1.Implement risk reduction and adaptation measures<br/><br/>Governments can work with insurers to promote risk reduction and adaptation strategies. In the context of wildfires, this could include:</p><p><ul><li>Enforcing stricter building codes that require fire-resistant materials</li><li>Supporting vegetation management programmes and creating defensible spaces around properties</li><li>Offering subsidies or tax incentives for households and businesses to invest in fire-resistant practices</li></ul></p><p>2.Enhance data sharing and risk modelling<br/><br/>Governments should foster collaboration between insurers, scientists, and public agencies to improve wildfire risk assessments. Access to accurate, up-to-date data can inform both insurance pricing and land-use planning, ensuring that risk is managed effectively at all levels.<br/><br/>3.Expand access to insurance in high-risk area<br/><br/>In regions where wildfire risks are high, governments can support insurance availability through catastrophe risk insurance programmes or public-private insurance programmes that support affordability through risk sharing and ensure coverage is available to those at risk.<br/><br/>4.Integrate climate adaptation into broader policy frameworks<br/><br/>Policy makers should embed wildfire risk management into climate adaptation strategies, ensuring that land-use planning, emergency response, and insurance policies are aligned.<br/><br/>5.Leverage insurance to drive resilience<br/><br/>Insurance mechanisms should be designed not only to transfer risk but also to incentivise resilience. For example, offering lower premiums for properties built or retrofitted with fire-resistant features can encourage widespread adoption of mitigation practices.<br/><br/>Looking into the future<br/><br/>The rising threat of wildfires and other climate risks demands a proactive approach to risk management, with insurance serving as a cornerstone of resilience. However, the challenges posed by escalating risks require a concerted effort by policy makers to ensure that insurance remains accessible and affordable - and encourages the investments in risk reduction and adaptation that are needed to ensure the long-term sustainability of insurance markets. By implementing the OECD's recommendations—such as promoting risk reduction, improving data sharing, and fostering public-private insurance programmes—governments can build a more resilient future where communities are better protected against the growing menace of wildfires.<br/><br/>Learn more about OECD work on insurance and climate risks<br/><br/>For more insights on this topic, explore the full OECD reports on Enhancing the Insurance Sector’s Contribution to Climate Adaptation and on Building Financial Resilience to Climate Impacts.

    "news_content": "<p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20250410_m_en/6.png' style='width: 100%;' /><br/></p><p>Published 10 February, 2025 Type WBCSD insight<br/><br/>Authors Surbhi Singhvi, Manager, Heat decarbonization and Renewables, WBCSD; Sem Oxenaar, Associate, Regulatory Assistance Project (RAP)<br/><br/>The annual average global temperature has exceeded the 1.5°C threshold for the first time, making 2024 a significant year for climate change. This alarming milestone, however, does not represent a global defeat of the efforts outlined in the Paris Agreement. Rather, it underscores the urgent need for accelerated action – more so in areas with a substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions footprint like process heat in industry.<br/><br/>This article highlights the importance of and key barriers to industrial process heat decarbonization. By examining the best practices of policy approaches to industrial process heat decarbonization, we emphasize how value chain collaboration amongst businesses and targeted policy support are key to drive meaningful change and ensure industrial process heat is no longer the missing piece of the decarbonization puzzle.<br/><br/>Why does the decarbonization of industrial process heat matter?<br/><br/>Industrial process heat constitutes around 18% of global GHG emissions annually. This is equivalent to the combined GHG emissions of the US and India, two of the top three emitters in the world in 2023. Today, many solutions, including direct electrification, thermal storage, sustainable bioenergy, solar thermal and geothermal, offer opportunities to decarbonize industrial process heat. Most of these solutions are already commercially available, particularly for low (<200°C) and medium (200-400°C) temperatures– which together make up 50% of the total industrial heat demand. [i]<br/><br/>Heat also accounts for a significant portion of Scope 1 GHG emissions for most industrial companies. This elevates process heat decarbonization as a clear actionable opportunity for businesses to advance their decarbonization goals.<br/><br/>Yet, despite businesses recognizing the importance of process heat decarbonization and the current availability of renewable heat[ii] solutions, their adoption remains remarkably low: the share of renewable heat in final energy used for industrial heating has only increased from 10% in 2015 to 12% in 2023. [iii]<br/><br/>What are the barriers to the widespread adoption of renewable heat solutions?<br/><br/></p><p><ul><li>Uncertainty about commercial viability and operational risks associated with technology investments, given high upfront investments and the early stage of adoption in case of many renewable heat solutions.</li><li>Cost difference between fossil fuels and decarbonized energy carriers, including through taxes and levies. For example, in many countries electricity is taxed at much higher rates than gas. In some cases, subsidies to fossil fuels give a further advantage to the conventional and high emitting energy sources. </li><li>Lack of awareness about which decarbonization technology is the most suitable, due to rapid evolution of technology solutions.[iv]</li><li>Persistent infrastructural challenges, with many regions struggling to ensure adequate grid capacity for industrial-scale electrification.</li></ul></p><p>Fortunately, these challenges can be addressed by adopting a targeted and coordinated approach between businesses and policymakers, as shown by the pioneering policy approaches illustrated below.<br/><br/>How is policy support helping overcome the barriers?<br/><br/>Many countries provide policy incentives to businesses for industrial decarbonization. This article highlights a few that support adoption of early-stage technology solutions particularly for industrial process heat decarbonization.<br/><br/>Industrial Demonstrations Program (US)<br/><br/>The Industrial Demonstrations Program, active as of 2024, in the US aimed at providing financial support to projects demonstrating technical and commercial viability of emerging technologies capable of decarbonizing industry. The program selected projects based on their ability to decarbonize in the near-term and to attract follow-on investments to significantly scale up technology adoption, prioritizing those that include partnerships between buyers and suppliers. With an approved financial support of up to $75 million, Diageo plans to partner with Rondo Energy and National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to replace natural gas fired boilers with a combination of renewable heat solutions, including heat batteries and e-boilers at two of its locations. If successful, this will help Diageo scale up adoption across its other locations around the world. Kraft Heinz is undertaking a similar project with approved financial support from the government of up to $170.9 million across 11 of its locations in the US. Both these projects would stand as test cases for companies not only in the food and beverages industry, but also for other manufacturing companies in textiles, paper and pulp, pharmaceuticals and chemicals for processes with similar heat requirements.<br/><br/>SDE ++ and DEI + Schemes (Netherlands)<br/><br/>In the Netherlands, the Sustainable Energy Production and Climate Transition Subsidy (SDE++) scheme provides an operational subsidy covering the unprofitable component of the low-carbon heating solution with a cap of EUR 400/ ton of CO2 avoided by the technology’s use. Another relevant scheme is Demonstration Energy Innovation Subsidy (DEI+) to promote scale up of emerging technologies by supporting commercial scale demonstration projects through grants. Benefitting from these schemes, Eneco has partnered with PepsiCo and Kraftblock to procure renewable heat – through a combination of electrification with thermal storage – for PepsiCo’s operations. The inclusion of an energy utility – Eneco, whose core business is to supply and procure electricity – ensures that low-priced electricity is stored in the thermal storage system to supply heat to PepsiCo at a commercially attractive rate. Heat-as-a-service agreements as a result of such partnerships support in enhancing the commercial aspects of adoption of renewable heat solutions.<br/><br/>Carbon Contract for Difference Scheme for Industrial Transformation (Germany)<br/><br/>Another example comes from Germany, which introduced the cutting-edge Carbon Contract for Difference (CCFD) scheme to promote industrial transformation. As part of the scheme, the government commits to fund the higher production cost of using low-carbon solutions compared to fossil fuels, over a period of 15 years. Projects are selected based on price bids for every ton of CO2 avoided. As soon as companies start to gain from using renewable solutions, additional revenue must flow back to the government from industrial companies. Additionally, the fund dispersal is conditional upon the companies achieving their CO2 reduction targets. The German government has awarded up to €2.8 billion in the first round of this scheme. BASF is one of the 15 companies that has secured a funding approval of up to €310 million for its industrial heat pump project for steam generation at its Ludwigshafen site in Germany. Through this scheme, the government secures CO2 reduction, while heat users get access to much-needed financial security when investing in novel technologies to reduce their carbon footprint.<br/><br/>Key commonalities: Policy support has been focused on decarbonization results<br/><br/>The support schemes make it increasingly possible for industrial users to accelerate the adoption of renewable heat solutions in a commercially viable manner. At the same time, they have provided start-ups offering credible and innovative renewable heat solutions like heat batteries market access and opportunity to scale their operations. <br/><br/>In the examples above, financial support has been open to all decarbonization technologies, provided that the technology of choice meets the operational and carbon reduction needs of companies. This plays a crucial role in preventing innovative and emerging technologies with great decarbonization potential from being overlooked. The schemes providing operational support, such as SDE++ and the German CCFD, are competitive and result-oriented i.e. subsidy payments are dependent on meeting GHG emissions reduction targets. Therefore, projects with the lowest cost per ton of emissions reduced are first in line for funding. This prioritization ensures that government investments support national decarbonization goals, while attracting credible projects.<br/><br/>Targeted policy support and value chain collaboration are key to industrial process heat decarbonization<br/><br/>The policy incentives outlined in this article demonstrate that challenges to heat decarbonization can be addressed. Targeted operational subsidies and grants to support the upfront investment in renewable heat technologies offer businesses more security, even when the payback periods are long, or the technology is new. Given the substantial contribution of industrial process heat to annual GHG emissions, a targeted policy support for industrial process heat decarbonization is the need of the hour.<br/><br/>Promoting value chain collaboration, as was done in the case of Industrial Demonstrations Program, can also go a long way in ensuring a self-sustaining market after an initial period of policy support. Partnerships amongst electric utilities, solution providers and industrial consumers for project implementation can facilitate sharing of risks, system optimization and division of tasks as per their expertise fostering a favorable environment for investment. Regions around the world could take inspiration from these innovative examples to kickstart adoption and build familiarity of businesses with renewable heat solutions.<br/><br/>As we strive to meet global emission reduction targets, we cannot understate the importance of industrial process heat decarbonization. A targeted policy push promoting collaboration across the business value chain will ensure that industrial process heat doesn’t remain a missing piece of the decarbonization puzzle.</p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.wbcsd.org/news/industrial-heat-an-overlooked-piece-in-the-decarbonization-puzzle/'>https://www.wbcsd.org/news/industrial-heat-an-overlooked-piece-in-the-decarbonization-puzzle/</a></p>",

Spearheaded by France, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the Coalition brings together stakeholders across the AI value chain for dialogue and ambitious collaborative initiatives.<br/><br/>The Coalition was announced at the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Summit in Paris, where Heads of State and Government, leaders of international organizations, CEOs, academics, artists, and members of civil society gathered to discuss support for AI innovation, adequate regulation, and respect for rights to ensure development of these technologies in the interests of all, including developing countries.<br/><br/>The Coalition will encourage AI initiatives for the planet, including its role in decarbonizing economies, reducing pollution, preserving biodiversity, protecting the oceans, and ensuring humanity operates within planetary boundaries. It will use a collaborative approach – bringing together governments, academia, civil society, and the private sector – to focus on standardized methods and metrics for measuring AI’s environmental impacts, comprehensive life cycle analysis frameworks for reporting and disclosure, and prioritization of research on sustainable AI.<br/><br/>“We know that AI can be a force for climate action and energy efficiency. But we also know AI power-intensive systems are already placing an unsustainable strain on our planet,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in his remarks at the Summit. “So it is crucial to design AI algorithms and infrastructures that consume less energy and integrate AI into smart grids to optimize power use.”<br/><br/>While AI may help tackle some of the world’s biggest environmental emergencies – for instance, it is being used to map the destructive dredging of sand and chart emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas – a growing body of research cautions that there is a negative side to the explosion of AI and its associated infrastructure, including the electronic waste produced – and high levels of electricity and water consumed – by the proliferating data centres that house AI servers produce electronic waste.<br/><br/>From data centres to training models, AI must run on sustainable energy that  fuels a more sustainable future. The Coalition aims to build sustainable AI into the global discussion in much the same way AI security or AI ethics are studied.<br/><br/>“The AI Action Summit is a turning point: for the first time, the ecological transition has been at the core of the discussions in a international AI summit. I am very proud that France organized this first Forum for sustainable AI with 200 stakeholders present,” said Agnès Pannier-Runacher, France’s Minister of Ecological Transition, Energy, Climate and Risk Prevention. “Today, my Ministry, with ITU and UNEP, launched the Coalition for Sustainable AI - more than 90 members, including 37 companies, have joined this ambitious initiative on green AI and AI for green.”<br/><br/>More than 190 countries have adopted a series of non-binding recommendations on the ethical use of AI, which covers the environment. In addition, both the European Union and the United States of America have introduced legislation to temper the environmental impact of AI. However, the policy landscape remains sparse.<br/><br/>A number of recent initiatives are working to build the knowledge base around AI and the environment: through the National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology (INRIA) and the French Ministry of Ecological Transition, a community of 36 scientists, companies, public institutions and international organizations have published a position paper identifying the challenges that must be overcome to maximize the positive effects of AI systems while limiting their environmental impact. The first hackathon combining AI and energy sobriety, the Frugal AI Challenge, also brought together more than 60 teams of data scientists around the unprecedented challenge of designing AI models related to environmental issues, including the detection of climate disinformation, analysis of regions at risk of fires, identification of illegal deforestation) while optimizing their energy efficiency. In addition, the first international working group on the use of generative AI to provide access to environmental knowledge aims to develop a best practice guide for the effective and ethical use of generative AI to provide access to environmental documents, while a multi-stakeholder Green Digital Action initiative, convened by ITU, has launched a new thematic pillar on green computing with a dedicated Sustainable AI working group.<br/><br/>In 2024, UNEP released an issue note that explores AI’s environmental footprint and considers how the technology can be rolled out sustainably; it followed a major UNEP report, Navigating New Horizons, which also examined AI’s promise and perils. In 2025, UNEP will publish a guide to encourage public and private purchases towards energy-efficient data centres. These guidelines will be based on international best practices and established global standards (EU Code of Conduct, Energy Star, ISO/IEC 30134, etc.). They will inform investors, development banks and local authorities on the objective elements defining an energy-efficient data centre.<br/><br/>“The power of AI to solve complex global challenges is becoming ever clearer, but so too are its environmental impacts and the need for environmental guardrails to ensure the field grows sustainably,” said Golestan (Sally) Radwan, Chief Digital Officer for UNEP. “The new Coalition brings together critical stakeholders who have the power to work together and build systems that ensure the net effect of AI on the planet is positive as the technology continues to deploy rapidly.”<br/><br/></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/new-coalition-aims-put-artificial-intelligence-more-sustainable-path'>https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/new-coalition-aims-put-artificial-intelligence-more-sustainable-path</a></p>",

A key focus is the Agri-NBSAPs Support Initiative, launched at COP16 in Cali, Colombia.<br/><br/>The initiative is designed to help governments integrate agrifood systems into their National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans, to eliminate any conflicts between agricultural policy and biodiversity goals.<br/><br/>Colombia’s COP16 President, Environment Minister María Susana Muhamad, and Agriculture Minister Martha Carvajalino, underscored the importance of full implementation.<br/><br/>Mr. Dongyu highlighted the deep connections between biodiversity and food security, noting that over half of the Kunming-Montreal Framework’s 23 targets are directly linked to agriculture.<br/><br/>He explained that “biodiversity is also in the soil and in the water” and that it is critical “to look at biodiversity from a holistic, three-dimensional perspective”.<br/><br/>‘On the brink’: Guterres<br/><br/>Despite commitments made at COP15, funding remains a sticking point.<br/><br/>Secretary-General António Guterres, warned in a statement that biodiversity is “on the brink” and urged governments to translate pledges into investment. “Success requires accountability. And action demands finance,” he said.<br/><br/>With only a fraction of the required $200 billion per year mobilised, developing nations are pushing wealthier countries to meet their financial obligations.<br/><br/>Discussions in Rome are expected to focus on accountability frameworks to track spending and ensure resources reach the communities most affected by biodiversity loss.<br/><br/>What’s next?<br/><br/>In the coming days, negotiators will work to finalise agreements on biodiversity finance, implementation strategies and monitoring frameworks.<br/><br/>Mr. Dongyu closed his statement by calling for an integrated approach across government sectors.<br/><br/>“We need an integrated approach across government sectors, across Ministries, to ensure the Four Betters: better production, better nutrition, better environment and a better life – leaving no one behind,” he said.<br/><br/>With time running out to meet the 2030 targets, COP16.2 is a key test of global commitment – whether countries will step up or risk falling short on protecting the planet’s ecosystems.<br/><br/></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/02/1160496'>https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/02/1160496</a></p>",

    "news_summary": "",
    "image_path": "",
    "news_content": "<p>20 February 2025<br/><br/>There is an urgent need to adapt healthcare systems to better meet the needs of the growing number of people with chronic conditions, according to the findings of the first international OECD survey of patients with chronic health conditions, the Patient-Reported Indicator Surveys (PaRIS).<br/><br/>The survey collected data from about 107 000 patients aged 45 years and older, and 1 800 primary care practices across 19 countries.* It aims to shed light on the health outcomes and experiences of people living with chronic conditions, such as hypertension, arthritis, diabetes, heart disease or cancer, which are managed in primary healthcare settings.<br/><br/>82% of primary care users who took part in PaRIS live with at least one chronic condition, 52% live with at least two conditions, and 27% live with three conditions or more.<br/><br/>Most people report positive care experiences and better health results, compared to the OECD average, in Switzerland, and in the United States focusing on the population aged 65 years and older in Medicare. In Australia, Czechia, France and Norway, most people also report positive experiences and outcomes of care. Countries with below-average scores on more than half of the indicators are Greece, Iceland, Portugal, Romania and Wales (United Kingdom).<br/><br/>“People living with chronic conditions report better physical health, mental health and well-being when they receive healthcare that is centred on their needs,” OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said. “PaRIS also shows that, while countries that spend more on health tend to achieve better health outcomes, it is possible to achieve strong performance also with lower levels of health spending.”<br/><br/>PaRIS finds that four in ten patients do not feel confident in managing their own health; additionally, four in ten do not trust their healthcare system. To deliver better health, healthcare needs to dedicate more time to patients. 64% of people who report that their primary care professional spends enough time with them trust the healthcare system, compared with 34% for people who say that their primary care professional does not spend enough time with them. Healthcare must also be better tailored to people’s needs. Only one quarter of patients report having a care plan prepared for them by their health professional.<br/><br/>Healthcare needs to be ‘trouble-free’ and reliable, says the report. 45% of people who have experienced a negative episode in the healthcare system that could potentially cause them harm, such as not getting an appointment when needed or receiving a wrong or delayed diagnosis or treatment, trust their healthcare system, compared with 70% of people who have not experienced such a negative episode.<br/><br/>Other key highlights from PaRIS include:<br/><br/></p><p><ul><li>The well-being of patients deteriorates rapidly with the number of chronic conditions. The average well-being score (measured by WHO-5, a scale from 0 to 100) is 14 points lower among people with three or more chronic conditions compared to people with one chronic condition.</li><li>There are large gender gaps in patients’ experiences and outcomes. Out of all people with chronic conditions, 74% of men are in good physical health compared to 65% of women, and 86% of men are in good mental health compared to 81% of women. This confirms the gender-health paradox: women tend to live longer than men, yet they report worse health outcomes. Women also report to have less trust in healthcare and are less likely to experience good quality of care.</li><li>Digital technology is not being used to its full potential in healthcare. Only 7% of patients with chronic conditions report having used a video-consultation in primary care, and 17% report having accessed their primary care medical records online. Moreover, only 43% of patients with low education agree that their primary care provider’s website is easy to use.</li></ul></p><p>The report serves as a call to action for healthcare systems to involve patient perspectives more closely in decision-making. Its findings can inform national healthcare strategies, improve service delivery, and support the shift towards more integrated and people-centred models of care.<br/><br/>The full PaRIS Flagship Report is available for download here.<br/><br/>For media inquiries, interview requests, or further information, journalists are invited to contact Spencer Wilson in the OECD Media Office (+33 1 45 24 81 18).<br/><br/>Note: * Participating countries are Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czechia, France, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, the United States and Wales (United Kingdom).<br/><br/></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2025/02/healthcare-systems-need-to-better-respond-to-patients-needs-finds-first-international-oecd-patient-survey.html'>https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2025/02/healthcare-systems-need-to-better-respond-to-patients-needs-finds-first-international-oecd-patient-survey.html</a></p>",

Aligned with the aims of IWA 48, ISO’s strategic framework for implementing and reporting on sustainable development, social justice and good governance, the Government of Indonesia has introduced various policies and initiatives to promote sustainability across a variety of sectors. This effort is part of a broader global movement towards a cleaner, more responsible future.<br/><br/>In Indonesia, ESG has quickly taken centre stage after the Government of Indonesia declared its commitment to achieve the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. At the G20 Summit in Brazil in November 2024, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto reaffirmed his country’s dedication to sustainable development and a rapid energy transition.<br/><br/>The National Standardization Agency of Indonesia (BSN) echoed this commitment by hosting a panel discussion on 21 November 2024, during Indonesia’s National Quality Month celebrations. The session, opened by BSN Chairman Kukuh S. Achmad and Deputy Chairman Hendro Kusumo, underscored the agency’s critical role in developing standards that support global sustainability. It also featured video messages from leaders of three international standards organizations, including ISO Secretary-General Sergio Mujica.<br/><br/>The standards developed by BSN provide organizations with the necessary framework to meet their ESG objectives, regardless of where they are on their sustainability journey. By addressing environmental factors (such as carbon footprint and waste management), social aspects (like diversity and human rights) and governance practices (including transparency and regulatory compliance), these standards help organizations adopt a comprehensive and strategic approach to ESG.<br/><br/>As part of these celebrations, the prestigious Herudi Technical Committee Awards were presented, highlighting the country’s commitment to advancing excellence in standardization and quality enhancement. Five technical committees were recognized for their exemplary work in areas such as fisheries products, food product sensory analysis, disaster management, solar energy, and geographic information/geomatics.<br/><br/>By showcasing these outstanding achievements, BSN aims to ignite a new era of excellence in standardization, positioning Indonesia as a key leader in global sustainability.<br/><br/></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.iso.org/contents/news/2025/01/indonesia-sustainable-future.html'>https://www.iso.org/contents/news/2025/01/indonesia-sustainable-future.html</a></p>",

These are the key findings of an annual review of the buildings and construction sector, published today by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (GlobalABC).<br/><br/>The Global Status Report for Buildings and Construction 2024-2025 - Not just another brick in the wall highlights progress made on related global climate goals and calls for greater ambition on six challenges, including building energy codes, renewable energy, and financing. Global frameworks and initiatives such as Intergovernmental Council for Buildings and Climate, the Buildings Breakthrough and the Declaration de Chaillot are sustaining momentum towards adopting ambitious climate action plans, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), for net-zero buildings ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belem, Brazil.<br/><br/>“The buildings where we work, shop and live account for a third of global emissions and a third of global waste,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. “The good news is that government actions are working. But we must do more and do it faster. I encourage all countries to include plans to rapidly cut emissions from buildings and construction in their new NDCs.”<br/><br/>Reviewing the decade since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015, the report finds 2023 was the first year when continued growth of building construction was decoupled from associated sector greenhouse gas emissions, which have previously plateaued.<br/><br/>By adopting mandatory building energy codes aligned with net-zero emissions, mandatory performance standards and seizing energy efficiency investments, the sector’s energy intensity has reduced by almost 10% while the renewable energy share in final energy demand has increased by nearly 5%. Additional measures such as circular construction practices, green leases, energy efficient retrofitting of existing buildings, and prioritizing the use of low carbon materials can further reduce energy consumption, enhance waste management and reduce emissions overall.<br/><br/>Despite this progress, the sector remains a key driver of the climate crisis, consuming 32 per cent of global energy and contributing to 34 per cent of global CO2 emissions. The sector is dependent on materials like cement and steel that are responsible for 18% of global emissions and are a major source of construction waste.<br/><br/>Given nearly half of the world’s buildings that will exist by 2050 have not yet been built, the adoption of ambitious energy building codes is critical. However, data points to a recent decline in highly effective measures like heat pump installations and over 50 per cent of newly constructed floorspace in emerging and developing economies is still not covered by building codes.<br/><br/>The report sets out a challenge to major carbon-emitting countries to adopt zero-carbon building energy codes by 2028, to be followed by all other countries no later than 2035. Building codes and integrating building code reform plans in the ongoing submission of NDCs are critical to achieve the COP28 Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency Pledge.<br/><br/>Finally, all governments, financial institutions and businesses need to work together to double global building energy efficiency investment from USD 270 billion to USD 522 billion by 2030. Adoption of Extended Producer Responsibility measures, and circular economy practices - including longer building lifespans, better material efficiency and reuse, recycling, passive design, and waste management - are key to help bridge gaps in financing, while workforce development programmes are essential to fill skill gaps in the sector.<br/><br/>UNEP, GlobalABC members, and other partners will continue to support countries and businesses to decarbonise new and existing buildings and the entire building value chain, including using this data to support ambitious NDCs ahead of COP30.</p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/emissions-building-sector-stopped-rising-first-time-2020-un-finds'>https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/emissions-building-sector-stopped-rising-first-time-2020-un-finds</a></p>",

In 1972, King Jigme Singye Wangchuck of the small, landlocked Asian state of Bhutan coined the Gross National Happiness index.<br/><br/>It captures four areas: sustainable development, conservation of the environment, preservation and promotion of culture – and good governance.<br/><br/>Likewise, the Human Development Index is often cited as another alternative to evaluate the overall development and well-being of a nation, taking into account life expectancy, standards of living, and education.<br/><br/>An increasing amount of research reveals that the GDP model is insufficient, says Nathalie Bernasconi of the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) – and change-makers must find ways to translate the scientific evidence into national policies.<br/><br/>They should also create incentives for governments to move away from an outdated, GDP-heavy paradigm that was created in the 1930s, in the aftermath of the Great Depression, by the economist Simon Kuznets to measure economic output and help policymakers respond to the crisis.<br/><br/>“GDP alone cannot guide us towards this future,” said Ms. Bernasconi, who is Vice-President of Global Strategies and Managing Director for Europe at IISD.<br/><br/>Not sustainable<br/><br/>GDP is not necessarily a reliable indicator of sustainability and can even increase after costly accidents such as oil spills, owing to intensive clean-up operations, as was the case with the BP Deepwater Horizon oil disaster in 2010.<br/><br/>Another environmental disaster in Alaska in 1989 – the Exxon Valdez spill – temporarily  boosted GDP in the United States, thanks to job creation and a rise in demand for services.<br/><br/>But while the tragedy initially inflated GDP, it also caused pervasive harm to the ecosystem and local communities – long-term losses not captured by the indicator.<br/><br/>“Why do we value dead things? Why value a dead tree, rather than the living tree providing oxygen?” said Bingying Lou of the Beyond Lab, citing an indigenous environmental activist.<br/><br/></p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20250508_m_en/4.jpg' style='width: 100%;' /><br/>© WHO/Anna Kari / The SDGs focus on eliminating poverty and providing people with opportunities to prosper.</p><p>Multilateralism can fix debt crisis<br/><br/>Among those supporting calls to think creatively about reforming GDP and to “recommit to multilateralism” to find solutions for heavily indebted countries held back by classic financial models created after the Second World War, is Ambassador Matthew Wilson of the Permanent Mission of Barbados to the UN in Geneva.<br/><br/>“Recent months have shown that when you think you’re beyond – something, or someone, pulls you right back in,” he said.<br/><br/>Mr. Wilson added that while multilateralism has not worked perfectly, the world would be in a worse position without it.<br/><br/>We need to be forward-thinking but also active in solving issues like debt and development assistance, the ambassador stressed.<br/><br/>‘Status quo not viable anymore’<br/><br/>Whether politicians will venture away from campaigns focused on how much they have grown GDP and adopt other measurements, remains to be seen, said Ms. Aydogan.<br/><br/>“We have been taught a certain way to look at the economy,” she said. “But at the same time, the fact that we’re hitting all these planetary boundaries...shows us that the status quo is just simply not viable anymore.”<br/><br/>To take the discussion one step further, policymakers will convene at the International Conference on Financing for Development in Seville, Spain from June 30 to July 3, 2025, and at the World Social Summit in Doha, Qatar in November 2025.<br/><br/></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161711'>https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161711</a></p>",

Humanitarian aid dropped by an estimated 9.6% in 2024, amounting to USD 24.2 billion.<br/><br/>ODA used to cover refugee costs within donor countries fell by 17.3% in 2024 compared to 2023 and amounted to USD 27.8 billion, representing 13.1% of DAC member countries’ total ODA, down from 14.6% in 2023. For five countries, in-donor refugee costs still represented more than a quarter of their ODA in 2024.<br/><br/>The United States continued to be the largest DAC member country provider of ODA (USD 63.3 billion), accounting for 30% of total DAC ODA in 2024, followed by Germany (USD 32.4 billion), the United Kingdom (USD 18.0 billion), Japan (USD 16.8 billion), and France (USD 15.4 billion).<br/><br/>“It is regrettable that ODA decreased in 2024 after five years of continuous growth. It’s even more concerning that some of the major donors have signalled further, and quite significant, decreases over the coming years.” OECD DAC Chair Carsten Staur said. “In this situation, it is paramount that ODA is invested where it is most needed, especially in the poorest and most fragile countries. Going forward, poverty eradication, the just green transition and governance should remain at the core, and we must also make ODA work harder in mobilising other sources of finance. Doubling down on aid effectiveness, together with partner countries, will be the key to achieve this.” <br/><br/>ODA rose in ten DAC member countries and fell in twenty-two countries. Only four countries exceeded the United Nations’ target of 0.7% ODA to GNI: Denmark (0.71%), Luxembourg (1.00%), Norway (1.02%) and Sweden (0.79%).<br/><br/>Net bilateral ODA for programmes and projects and technical assistance, excluding in-donor refugees and humanitarian aid, fell slightly by 1.2% in real terms, due in part to the reduction in ODA for Ukraine. Net debt relief grants remained low at USD 241 million.<br/><br/>Preliminary estimates show that net bilateral ODA flows from DAC members to Africa stood at USD 42 billion in 2024, representing a fall of 1% in real terms compared to 2023. Within this total, net ODA to sub-Saharan Africa was USD 36 billion, a decrease of 2% in real terms.<br/><br/>Net bilateral aid flows from DAC members to the group of least developed countries (LDCs) were USD 35 billion, a fall of 3% in real terms compared to 2023.<br/><br/>Links to aid data and background information:<br/><br/>Interactive charts showing ODA trends over time up to 2024: Official development assistance (ODA).<br/><br/>More detail on ODA statistics including the breakdown for 2024: O.N.E - Preliminary official development assistance levels in 2024.<br/><br/>For further information, journalists are invited to contact Spencer Wilson in the OECD Media Office (+33 1 45 24 81 18).<br/><br/></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2025/04/official-development-assistance-2024-figures.html'>https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2025/04/official-development-assistance-2024-figures.html</a></p>",

At its core is the idea that technology could be a lifeline for millions across Somalia, where climate change is deepening poverty, worsening hunger and threatening to enflame a decades-long conflict.<br/><br/>“Climate change is a major threat,” says Hafsa Omar Abdilahi, who heads the climate change unit within the country’s environment ministry. “Technology will play a crucial role in enabling sustainable agriculture and improving water management.”<br/><br/></p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20250508_m_en/7.jpg' style='width: 100%;' /><br/>Somalia is widely viewed as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. In 2022 and 2023, the nation suffered its worst drought in 40 years. Credit: AFP/Tony Karumba</p><p>A fast-changing climate is unleashing weather-related disasters on many of the world’s developing countries – and many are ill-equipped to deal with them. UNEP’s Adaptation Gap Report 2024 found nations must dramatically step up their efforts to adapt to spiking global temperatures, which could rise a catastrophic 2.6-3.1°C this century. <br/><br/>Since 2009, the UNEP Copenhagen Climate Centre, with funding from the Global Environment Facility, has supported more than 100 countries as they developed plans for using technology to adapt to climate change and limit greenhouse gas emissions.<br/><br/>“Technology isn’t a proverbial silver bullet but when implemented well, and with sufficient funding, it can make a dramatic difference in the lives of those in the path of climate change,” says Anne Olhoff, the Interim Director of the UNEP Copenhagen Climate Centre.<br/><br/>Somalia is widely viewed as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. In 2022 and 2023, the nation suffered through its worst drought in 40 years. In 2024, it was hit by once-in-a-century floods. Those crises displaced 2.6 million people and sparked a hunger crisis in a country already suffering through a three-decade-long civil conflict. Against that backdrop, Somalia has been working with the UNEP Copenhagen Climate Centre on what is formally known as a technology needs assessment. The document explores interventions that could help the country adapt to extreme weather. Many of the interventions are relatively inexpensive to roll out, which officials considered key in a country where half the population lives on less than US$2 a day, according to government data.<br/><br/>The assessment calls for the installation of 261,000 rainwater collection tanks to be mounted on rooftops. That would benefit 1.5 million people—or roughly one in 10 Somalis. It also recommends digging 300 boreholes and outfitting them with solar-powered pumps, allowing 25,000 rural households to tap into underground water supplies. Drip irrigation, which uses small tubes to deliver water directly into the roots of plants, conserving supplies, could improve yields across 1,500 square kilometres of farmland. Finally, the report suggested Somalia build out a network of 200 automated weather stations, which could help warn residents of impending flash floods.<br/><br/></p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20250508_m_en/8.jpg' style='width: 100%;' /><br/>Experts say drip irrigation, which uses small tubes to deliver water directly into the roots of plants, could improve yields across 1,500 square kilometres of farmland. Credit: AFP/Tony Karumba</p><p>The findings have been rolled into other government planning documents, including Somalia’s national climate change pledges under the Paris Agreement, which Abdilahi said are expected to be released in a few months.<br/><br/>The government, in partnership with donors, is working to mobilize funds to support some of the interventions outlined in the assessment. The hope in part is that those technologies will reduce the often-fierce competition over scarce resources, like water and food, that enflames conflict and forces people to flee, says UNEP’s Olhoff.<br/><br/>“Not only in Somalia, but around the world climate change is already having a destabilizing effect on societies, fanning the flames of conflict,” she says. “Adaptation-related technologies can change that and, with the right support, help protect lives, and build more peaceful, more prosperous countries.”<br/><br/>Abdilahi says she’s hopeful that in the coming months, officials will be able to begin digging boreholes and roll out the early warning system for floods. But more than that, she’s heartened by the fact that documents like the technology needs assessment are helping to raise awareness about the dangers of climate change and the benefits of climate action, an issue, she says, that didn’t enter the public consciousness until late last decade.<br/><br/>“I’m optimistic,” says Abdilahi. “Year by year, the Somali people are understanding more about the effects of climate change. If people understand the problem, they can find a solution.”<br/><br/>Somalia is one of UNEP’s 2024 full-share funding partners, whose contributions to UNEP’s core fund, the Environment Fund, enable UNEP's global body of work. Learn how to support UNEP to invest in people and planet.<br/><br/>The Sectoral Solution to the climate crisis<br/><br/>UNEP is at the forefront of supporting the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global temperature rise well below 2°C, and aiming for 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels. To do this, UNEP has developed the Sectoral Solution, a roadmap to reducing emissions across sectors in line with the Paris Agreement commitments and in pursuit of climate stability. The six sectors identified are: energy; industry; agriculture and food; forests and land use; transport; and buildings and cities.<br/><br/></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/rainwater-tanks-and-solar-powered-pumps-somalia-aims-take-climate-change'>https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/rainwater-tanks-and-solar-powered-pumps-somalia-aims-take-climate-change</a></p>",

    "news_content": "<p>Published 05 May, 2025</p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20250527_m_en/1.png' style='width: 100%;' /><br/></p><p>In Hanoi on 10 April 2025, a clear message emerged from the high-level seminar “Advancing the ‘S’ in ESG”: that inequality undermines business performance, and addressing it can build resilience, maintain and increase market access, and reduce the cost of capital.<br/><br/>Hosted by UNDP in partnership with the Vietnam Business Council for Sustainable Development (VBCSD) and with support from the Government of Sweden, the event brought together business leaders, policymakers, and international experts to spotlight corporate approaches to the social dimension of ESG. This issue gaining focus due to greater scrutiny from export markets such as the European Union and Japan.<br/><br/>The session also marked the launch of the Vietnamese translation of “Advancing the ‘S’ in ESG,” a primer developed by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) in collaboration with Shift. Designed for CFOs in Vietnam, the guide helps business leaders understand, navigate, and plan for social and nature-related impacts across their operations, including effects on the workforce, value chain, affected communities and end-users.<br/><br/>Inequality: A Systemic Business Risk<br/><br/>Beginning his session with a timely provocation, Joe Phelan, Executive Director, Asia Pacific, at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), warned that inequality is now a systemic business risk.<br/><br/>Inequality poses a structural threat, not just to supply chains and business operations, but to investment portfolios and societal stability,” he said. “Managing a company’s corporate performance is now on the CFO agenda.<br/><br/>Joe’s remarks underscored a growing consensus: businesses that fail to integrate social considerations into their core strategies risk being left behind in an era where expectations are rising, across consumers, investors, and regulators alike.<br/><br/>He urged businesses in Vietnam to move beyond tick-box approaches and embed social impact into decision-making and value chains. This, he noted, will require stronger collaboration across sectors, better policy coherence, and investment in tools that allow companies, especially SMEs, to track, disclose and improve their social performance and accountability.<br/><br/>Social Performance as a Growth Driver<br/><br/>The event made clear that social sustainability is not merely a defensive play. It is a growth strategy.<br/><br/>H.E. Johan Ndisi, Ambassador of Sweden to Vietnam, set the tone in his remarks, framing responsible business conduct as a prerequisite for accessing and thriving in sustainability-conscious markets. “For economies like Vietnam, advancing the social dimension of ESG offers a strategic opening, one that can lead to fairer workplaces, stronger supply chains, and more sustainable trade partnerships,” he said.<br/><br/>Emphasising the central role of stakeholder engagement in shaping long-term business resilience, Ramla Khalidi, UNDP Vietnam Resident Representative, shared that “Companies that integrate human rights and environmental due diligence into their strategy aren’t just compliant, they’re future proof.” Her remarks echoed the consensus that stakeholder dialogue acts as a catalyst for growth.<br/><br/>That strategic framing was reinforced by Kassidy Huang of the World Benchmarking Alliance, who shared fresh data linking strong social practices to stronger financial performance. Companies leading on human rights and decent work consistently outperform on revenue and job creation, she noted. But Vietnamese firms must act fast. “Even if you’re not directly affected by EU rules like the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, your buyers are,” she said. “Those expectations will cascade.”<br/><br/>From Ideas to Action<br/><br/>Throughout the morning, a diverse set of voices, from corporates to community organisations, offered real-world examples of embedding social performance into business models. Discussions highlighted several enablers for scaling impact: stronger alignment between policy and practice, greater support for small and medium enterprises, and new financing models such as Orange Bonds, which unlock capital for gender and social equity initiatives.<br/><br/>As global ESG expectations continue to evolve, and the impacts of climate change, nature loss and rising inequality are being felt, businesses in Vietnam are at a crossroads. The path forward demands not just environmental ambition, but social innovation. The choice is clear: embrace the “S” in ESG as a business opportunity, one that builds resilience, earns trust, and drives inclusive growth.<br/><br/>As Joe Phelan put it, “This is not about charity. It’s about charting a course for a fairer, more stable, and ultimately more profitable future. The time to act is now.” “By strengthening performance management, companies can drive transformation through value chains, and get better information to the capital markets, so that finance flows to the companies that lead on sustainability performance.”<br/><br/></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.wbcsd.org/news/advancing-the-s-in-esg-how-vietnamese-companies-can-link-social-performance-with-competitiveness/'>https://www.wbcsd.org/news/advancing-the-s-in-esg-how-vietnamese-companies-can-link-social-performance-with-competitiveness/</a></p>",

    "news_summary": "",

    "news_content": "<p></p><p>Press release 15 May 2025<br/><br/>In today's digital world, where 98% of 15-year-olds in OECD countries have a smartphone, children enjoy unprecedented opportunities for learning, entertainment, and connecting with peers. However, early and excessive exposure to an online environment also creates risks. According to a new OECD report, a comprehensive approach to address children's digital lives must encompass evidence-based public policies, safety features in digital services, and clear guidance and support to educators and caregivers in helping children manage their engagement with digital technologies.<br/><br/>How’s Life for Children in the Digital Age? provides an overview of the current state of children's digital lives across OECD countries. It presents internationally comparable indicators on digital use and experiences and makes recommendations to ensure that children are both protected and empowered to use digital media in a beneficial way while managing potential risks.<br/><br/>Informed by the most recent international data available[1] the report includes 45 internationally comparable indicators related to children’s access and use of digital technologies, online social interactions, negative experiences, and practices that increase or reduce risk. For example, while 51% of 15-year-old students in OECD countries report being able to easily adjust digital settings to protect their privacy, 27.6% report sharing made-up information on social networks and 17% report feeling nervous or anxious without their digital devices. The indicators covered in the Report refer to specific, measurable behaviours, providing a new practical resource to guide policy decisions related to children’s well-being.<br/><br/></p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20250527_m_en/2.png' style='width: 100%;' /><br/></p><p>The data also shows that cyberbullying is on the rise across all OECD countries and a significant minority of children report problematic social media use. In addition, extended periods of time spent online are found to crowd out other valuable and enriching activities such as reading, physical exercise, or in-person socialising with friends, which are widely recognised as essential for children's cognitive and socio-emotional development.<br/><br/>“It is key for all stakeholders to work together to protect and support children as they navigate the digital world, also considering their offline situation as risks to children's well-being in both worlds often reinforce one another,” OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said. “Strengthening regulation and other policy tools, enhancing children’s digital literacy and skills, providing guidance for parents and caregivers, expanding the evidence base on children’s digital activities and their impacts and incorporating children's perspectives into policy design can all help to improve safety, well-being and opportunities in the online world.”<br/><br/>Encouragingly, the collection of data on children's activities and engagement in digital spaces is increasing in many countries. However, the indicators also reveal important gaps. For example, many countries still lack comprehensive data on the amount of time children spend on screens and digital activities, the nature of those activities, and the impacts of screen exposure and use on children of all ages. Addressing these gaps would enhance countries’ monitoring capacities, understanding, and ability to mitigate the risks to children’s well-being. The report provides guidance on how existing data sources could be leveraged to address data gaps and highlights the importance of capturing the perspectives of stakeholders including parents, children, educators, digital service providers, health professionals and experts to inform the development of effective policies and supports.<br/><br/>Journalists are invited to contact Johanna Gleeson in the OECD Media Office (+33 1 45 24 97 00) for further information or to request interviews.<br/><br/>For more information on well-being visit the OECD’s Centre on Well-Being, Inclusion, Sustainability and Equal Opportunity (WISE).<br/><br/>[1] The OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022 Database, the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) WHO Collaborative Cross-National Survey 2021-22 and the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement's (IEA) Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) 2021.<br/><br/></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2025/05/oecd-calls-for-an-ambitious-approach-to-protect-and-empower-children-online.html'>https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2025/05/oecd-calls-for-an-ambitious-approach-to-protect-and-empower-children-online.html</a></p>",

    "news_content": "<p>21 May 2025 / Story / Chemicals & pollution action<br/><br/>Officials in Lagos, Nigeria, were facing a dilemma.<br/><br/>It was the early 2020s, and the city of 22 million was being overwhelmed by plastic pollution. Water sachets and takeaway containers were clogging canals, littering streets and bursting from landfills.<br/><br/>But as evident as the problem was, city officials needed to know exactly how much plastic pollution Lagos was generating. The data that would be key to developing policy solutions. So, the city partnered with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) to conduct the first-ever audit of its waste.<br/><br/>The results were surprising. Some 34 kg of plastic waste per person per year was leaking into Lagos’ water system. That’s the equivalent of every Lagos resident throwing 10 plastic water bottles into waterways every single day.<br/><br/>The revelations, Lagos officials say, led the Lagos State government in 2024 to ban all single-use food containers made from polystyrene foam, also known as styrofoam. “The data convinced us to stand up with our political will,” says Tokunbo Wahab, Environment and Water Resources Commissioner in the Lagos State government.<br/><br/>Lagos is one of a growing number of cities that are attempting to use data, often painstakingly gathered through dumpsite visits and household surveys, to rein in plastic waste and end plastic pollution. The research has spawned bans on single-use plastics and new investments in waste management infrastructure. Experts say measures like those are crucial for curbing plastic pollution, which they called a growing threat to the environment.<br/><br/>“Worldwide, there are yawning data gaps and reliability issues when it comes to plastic waste and plastic pollution,” says Sinikinesh Jimma, head of UNEP’s Marine and Freshwater Branch. “Plugging those is crucial for developing evidence-based policies and countering what is a mushrooming crisis.”<br/><br/>The world generated around 400 million tonnes of plastic waste in 2024, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. That number is expected to nearly triple within the next 25 years, with some of the steepest rises coming in developing countries, especially in the Africa and Asia-Pacific regions. If current trends hold, much of that plastic will end up in rivers, lakes and the ocean.<br/><br/></p><p></p><p><img alt='' src='https://www.ctspcsr.com.tw/media/20250527_m_en/5.jpg' style='width: 100%;' /><br/>Some 34 kg of plastic waste per person, per year, was leaking into Lagos’ water system. That’s the equivalent of every Lagos resident throwing 10 plastic water bottles into waterways every single day. Credit: AFP/ Benson Ibeabuchi</p><p>As widespread as plastic waste and pollution are, there’s a dearth of data about them, says Jimma. That makes it difficult for government officials to justify pricey investments in waste management infrastructure, like recycling centres.<br/><br/>But efforts are underway to arm local and national officials with the data they need. UNEP and UN-Habitat, for example, have developed what’s known as the Waste Wise Cities Tool, a series of guidelines that help cities gauge how much plastic waste they’re generating.<br/><br/>The tool underpinned an audit in the bustling Kenyan port city of Mombasa. There, officials sifted through the trash of dozens of volunteer families, both high- and low-income, cataloguing how much plastic and other waste it contained. Surveyors also visited landfills, charting the volume of plastic waste and recording whether it came from formal or informal collectors.<br/><br/>The research showed that only about 50 per cent of Mombasa’s waste was collected and just 5 per cent was recovered in 2020. The data helped the city attract financing for a plastic waste sorting plant. Two international aid agencies are now weighing a large-scale investment that would improve Mombasa’s entire municipal solid waste system.<br/><br/>The waste measurement guidelines co-developed by UNEP are “providing the scientific data that we are using to develop bankable project proposals, and mobilize funds and private sector investment,” said Francis Thoya, Deputy Governor of Mombasa County.<br/><br/>Experts say the lack of waste- and pollution-related data globally is part of a larger plastic information gap. Few comprehensive metrics cover things like the production of plastic polymers, and how plastic products are designed, manufactured and recycled.<br/><br/>“A holistic understanding of the entire life cycle of plastics, from production to disposal, is necessary to develop comprehensive strategies that effectively counter plastic pollution,” says Jimma.<br/><br/>Waste-related data from Mombasa, and other cities, is being piped into the Global Plastics Hub, a platform developed by UNEP and backed by the Global Partnership on Plastic Pollution and Marine Litter. The hub, which has been funded by the governments of Japan, Norway and the United States of America, is designed to be a one-stop shop where government officials – and others – can track 80 plastic-pollution-related indicators. The portal is among the most comprehensive platforms of its kind in the world. In-depth country dashboards track how much plastic countries trade, how they manage plastic waste and what policies they have to counter plastic pollution. It’s designed to help countries make more informed decisions about how to address plastic pollution.<br/><br/>This year’s World Environment Day, an annual celebration of the Earth hosted by UNEP, will focus on solutions to end plastic pollution. It comes as global plastic waste – which is often linked to pollution – is set to reach nearly 1 billion tonnes a year by 2060.<br/><br/>“Many cities are running out of time to address this problem,” says Jimma. “It’s so important for municipalities to plug data gaps and make headway on reducing plastic pollution.”<br/><br/>UNEP's work is made possible by flexible contributions from Member States and other partners to the Environment Fund and UNEP Climate, Nature and Pollution funds. These funds enable agile, innovative solutions to climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste.

The goal is to enhance the uptake of sustainability reporting in Sri Lanka on sector-relevant topics – such as labor practices, waste and climate change. The ITSB will also explore how to achieve user-friendly digital platforms to simplify reporting and support greater inclusion of smaller companies. <br/><br/>The ITSB initiative represents a pivotal step forward for Sri Lanka’s textiles and apparel industry. By embracing the GRI Standards and strengthening reporting, businesses can take meaningful action to improve their social and environmental impacts across the value chain. In doing so, they not only enhance competitiveness and resilience, but also foster greater trust with stakeholders. Transparency on impacts becomes more than a compliance tool – it is a driver of inclusive growth that benefits people, the planet, and society at large.<br/><br/>-Dr. Aditi Haldar, Director of GRI South Asia<br/><br/>As Sri Lanka’s leading industry, textiles and apparel companies generates around 42% of total export revenue and sustain over 350,000 directs jobs nationwide. <br/><br/>The ITSB program, supported by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), is also planned to be rolled out in India and Bangladesh in the second half of 2025. The ITSB aligns with the recently launched Action Plan to Develop Inclusive and Sustainable Business Capacities in Sri Lanka, developed by SDC in collaboration with the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific’s Ministry of Industries and Technical Assistance.<br/><br/></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.globalreporting.org/news/news-center/fostering-transparency-across-sri-lanka-s-textiles-industry/'>https://www.globalreporting.org/news/news-center/fostering-transparency-across-sri-lanka-s-textiles-industry/</a></p>",

Bill’s interview begins in the section, “Communicating Supply Chain Risk in a Climate-Disrupted World.”<br/><br/>In this interview, Bill discusses the shifting landscape of climate risk disclosure and corporate governance in the wake of the SEC’s withdrawal of its proposed climate rule. He emphasizes that while the rule’s abandonment has made it harder for internal sustainability teams to secure investment, it hasn’t stopped forward-looking companies from addressing climate risks. Bill urges businesses to see regulatory uncertainty as a strategic opportunity to embed resilience into core planning. He highlights the importance of aligning with international frameworks like TCFD and CSRD, not just for compliance, but to enhance long-term value, competitiveness, and investor trust. <br/><br/>Bill also explains the role of the newly approved Green Impact Exchange (GIX), which aims to channel capital toward climate-resilient businesses by requiring strong climate risk disclosures from its listed companies. He underscores that disclosure should not be treated as a box-ticking exercise, but as a driver of operational and strategic insight across areas like supply chain, business continuity, and product viability. Bill calls for reframing “ESG” and “supply chain risk” in language that resonates more broadly, connecting it to issues like economic stability, consumer needs, and national security. In this interview, Bill stresses that real resilience is not about redundancy but about smarter, more localized and equitable design. Ultimately, Bill emphasizes that the conversation must shift from ideological framing to one grounded in practical business performance and societal benefit.<br/><br/></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.wbcsd.org/news/insights-communicating-supply-chain-risk-in-a-climate-disrupted-world/'>https://www.wbcsd.org/news/insights-communicating-supply-chain-risk-in-a-climate-disrupted-world/</a></p>",

    "news_content": "<p>2 July 2025</p><p><a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzVP-IVKmw8'>Watch the launch event here</a></p><p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have presented today a new plan to expand the scope and global coverage of their shared Tax Inspectors Without Borders (TIWB) programme, marking a new phase in the flagship capacity-building initiative.<br/><br/>Tax Inspectors Without Borders 2.0, presented during the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development (FFD4), in Sevilla, Spain, will build on a decade of impactful collaboration between OECD, UNDP and governments worldwide while adapting its activities to the evolving challenges of international taxation. To date, the initiative has enabled countries to mobilise an additional USD 2.4 billion in revenue, of which USD 1.91 billion has been raised across Africa alone.<br/><br/>TIWB will continue its signature mission – the deployment of experienced tax experts to work side-by-side with domestic audit teams in developing countries, strengthening local capacity through real-time support in concrete audits and investigations. This distinctive model will continue to enhance technical skills while enabling developing countries to address complex tax issues, such as transfer pricing and base erosion and profit shifting.<br/><br/>As part of FFD4, TIWB was selected to be a part of the Sevilla Platform for Action, a group of initiatives aimed at achieving measurable progress by advancing the renewed financing framework of the Sevilla outcome document, supported by a set of concrete actions.<br/><br/>Mathias Cormann, Secretary-General of the OECD, welcomed the launch of TIWB 2.0: “Looking ahead, we are optimistic that the Tax Inspectors Without Borders initiative will continue to adapt and respond to each jurisdiction’s specific needs and objectives, delivering responsive, country-led support that will improve tax administrations and boost domestic resource mobilisation. With ongoing donor engagement and reinforced partnerships, TIWB 2.0 is positioned to help developing countries strengthen tax capacity and meet the demands of a rapidly shifting global tax environment.”<br/><br/>With TIWB 2.0, the initiative will deepen its commitment to tailored assistance and institutional strengthening, while expanding into new areas of support. This will include helping developing countries address key emerging challenges, such as the digitalisation of the economy, complex cross-border transactions and new drivers of illicit financial flows.<br/><br/>Haoliang Xu, Acting Administrator of UNDP, said: “Over the past decade, Tax Inspectors Without Borders has shown how strengthening tax capacity at the national level unlocks domestic finance for sustainable development. By providing technical expertise in tax administrations, TIWB has helped countries reclaim billions to advance the Sustainable Development Goals. When tax systems are fair, efficient, and inclusive, they do more than fund public services, they rebuild trust, strengthen the social contract, and weave sustainability into the fabric of governance. But we need to scale up. Continued investment in TIWB will be essential to sustain this momentum and mobilise domestic resources to advance sustainability.”<br/><br/>The new developments were presented at FFD4 in Sevilla during an event, “Tax Inspectors Without Borders: A Decade of Impact and the Road Ahead”, together with partners from the OECD’s Forum on Tax Administration (FTA), the African Tax Administration Forum (ATAF), the Intergovernmental Forum on Mining, Minerals, Metals and Sustainable Development (IGF), and the International Centre for Tax and Development (ICTD).<br/><br/>Commissioner Edward Kieswetter of South Africa, Vice-Chair of the OECD FTA, which brings together over 50 of the world’s leading tax administrations, also attended the event, highlighting the vital role tax administrations play in supporting TIWB programmes through the provision of world-class experts. These strategic partnerships will be scaled up under TIWB 2.0, enhancing triangular co-operation and expanding engagement with international and regional institutions.<br/><br/>Since its launch in 2015, TIWB has supported 70 developing jurisdictions, securing USD 6.39 billion in tax assessments, including disallowed losses and deferred taxes, and collecting over USD 2.4 billion in additional tax revenues. In Africa alone, through its close collaboration with ATAF, 39 countries have raised more than USD 1.9 billion in additional revenues.<br/><br/>A 10-year retrospective report outlining these results and the initiative’s future direction was launched today, capturing a decade of achievements and lessons learned.<br/><br/>To read the full progress report and find out more about TIWB, visit: https://read.oecd.org/10.1787/e9762366-en.<br/><br/>For further information, journalists are invited to contact Lawrence Speer at the OECD Media Office (+33 1 45 24 97 00) or Victor Garrido Delgado, at the UNDP Media Office.<br/><br/></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2025/07/tax-inspectors-without-borders-present-plans-to-expand-international-tax-co-operation-for-sustainable-development-over-the-coming-decade.html'>https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2025/07/tax-inspectors-without-borders-present-plans-to-expand-international-tax-co-operation-for-sustainable-development-over-the-coming-decade.html</a></p>",

Coastal zones support more than 75% of the local population by providing, for example, marine species for fisheries or valuable non-timber forest products.<br/><br/>The new project aims to enhance the resilience of both ecosystems and communities through nature-based solutions, conventionally  referred to as ecosystem-based adaptation.<br/><br/>In close coordination with the Regional Directorates for Environment and Sustainable Development (DREDD), the project will support integrated coastal zone management structures, enhance national and local adaptation coordination, and provide revised tools and plans to integrate EbA at the regional and municipal levels.<br/><br/>The initiative will restore 3,000 hectares of mangroves and coastal forests and rehabilitate 2,000 hectares of degraded watersheds using community-based approaches. Over the course of the project, almost 100,000 people are expected to benefit directly from ecosystem-based adaptation interventions.<br/><br/>It will also support the creation of 20 ecosystem-based businesses, with a focus on empowering women and youth through access to training, technical support, and equipment. These businesses will span climate-resilient sectors such as sustainable fisheries, aquaculture, beekeeping, ecotourism, and rainfed agriculture.<br/><br/>An official high-level launch ceremony was held on 15 July at Hôtel Le Louvre Antaninarenina, bringing together representatives from national ministries, UN agencies, civil society, and development partners. <br/><br/>In her opening speech at the ceremony, the Secretary General of Environment and Sustainable Development Hahitantsoa Tokinirina Razafimahefa, said: “Restoring mangroves means protecting the coastline, supporting sustainable small-scale fishing, creating natural carbon sinks, and preserving nesting sites for rare species. In other words, it means acting on adaptation, mitigation, food security, and biodiversity conservation—all at once.”<br/><br/>Paz Lopez-Rey, UNEP’s Programme Management Officer for the new project, said: “The project will strengthen local governance for integrated coastal zone management, while ensuring the integration of ecosystem-based adaptation into key regional and municipal planning tools. But it will go further than that; it will lead to a national strategy to scale up ecosystem-based adaptation in other vulnerable coastal areas of the country.”<br/><br/>NOTES TO EDITORS<br/><br/>About the UN Environment Programme<br/><br/>UNEP is the leading global voice on the environment.

It addresses impacts across all levels of the supply chain and up to point-of-sale and the consultation is now open until 28 September 2025.<br/><br/>Central to the project to create a new GRI Sector Standard is the urgent need to address a lack of traceability and transparency in globally dispersed value chains of textile and apparel. This makes it challenging to identify, report on, and manage a variety of impacts, including water pollution from hazardous chemicals, excessive working hours, and gender discrimination. Additionally, organizations operating across multiple countries – each with diverse commercial and regulatory requirements – need a globally consistent set of metrics to meet both reporting needs and stakeholder expectations.<br/><br/>The global consultation seeks feedback from stakeholders on the exposure draft’s clarity, feasibility, completeness, and relevance. The aim is to enable more complete and consistent reporting by the textiles and apparel organizations that reflects their wide-ranging environmental, economic and social impacts, including on human rights.<br/><br/>Peter Dawkins, GRI Standards Senior Manager and project lead for developing the new Standard, said:“The textiles and apparel sector provides essential goods to millions of people across the world – but with its size, complexity and fragmentation come serious risks to people and planet. By enhancing accountability and transparency for their environmental, social and economic impacts, the new Sector Standard will aim to help organizations report more effectively and embed responsible business practices throughout their operations. We invite all stakeholders – from suppliers and brands to civil society and investors – to help shape a robust and practical standard that reflects the sector’s realities and opportunities.”<br/><br/>Chulendra de Silva is a member of the Global Sustainability Standards Board (GSSB), the independent body responsible for setting the GRI Standards. He said:“Sustainability in textiles and apparel is essential, given the industry’s far-reaching environmental impacts – from water and energy consumption to chemical use and waste generation. Social impacts are equally significant, affecting workers, retailers, and end-use customers. While responsible manufacturing and supply chain practices are vital, retailers also play a critical role by fostering respectful partnerships, ensuring fair pricing, and engaging proactively with suppliers. The GSSB believes that a new GRI Sector Standard for Textiles and Apparel can empower organizations to identify their most significant impacts and report on them with clarity and transparency – driving a more ethical, accountable and sustainable industry.”<br/><br/>To learn more about the proposed Standard, two free global webinars will take place – at 5pm CEST on 21 July and 10:00am CEST on 15 September – with registration now open. <br/><br/>Among the most notable impacts of textiles and apparel production are water pollution, the use of hazardous chemicals, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste – with over half of clothes and other textiles being incinerated or landfilled. The apparel industry, in particular, is labor-intensive, employing an estimated 70 million people, the majority of whom are young women. Poor working conditions, wages that do not meet the living standards, harassment and forced and child labor remain some of the biggest concerns for the sector.<br/><br/>The development process for the Textiles & Apparel Standard has been led by a multi-stakeholder Working Group, appointed by the GSSB under a due process protocol, consisting of 21 experts from the across the sector representing civil society, business enterprises, and mediating, labor and investment institutions.<br/><br/>GRI Sector Standards streamline reporting, providing a fast-track for companies with shared common activities to focus on the impacts on the economy, environment and society that matter most in their sector. More consistent reporting on sector-specific impacts increases transparency, accountability, and comparability. Reporting organizations start with the Universal Standards, then use applicable Sector Standard(s) to determine material topics, and report on those using relevant Topic Standards.<br/><br/></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.globalreporting.org/news/news-center/improving-transparency-in-global-fashion-value-chains/'>https://www.globalreporting.org/news/news-center/improving-transparency-in-global-fashion-value-chains/</a></p>",

Ten years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, a range of interlinked and persistent challenges continues to jeopardise the full realisation of the SDGs,” said Jakub Kulhánek, permanent representative of Czechia and one of the two lead facilitators of the declaration.<br/><br/>The clock is ticking<br/><br/>In the ministerial declaration, Member States said that time is running out to achieve the SDGs, which remain severely off track. <br/><br/>According to the Secretary-General’s report on the Goals, which was released on the first day of the HLPF, only 18 per cent of the SDGs are on track to be achieved by 2030, with over half making progress that is too slow. <br/><br/>While the ministerial declaration addressed each of the five SDGs in the spotlight at the forum, Member States particularly emphasised the role of poverty in impeding sustainable development and the worsening climate crisis that is threatening all aspects of the development agenda. <br/><br/>The declaration called both of these issues some of the “greatest global challenges” that the world faces.<br/><br/>In keeping with SDG 16, which underlines the role that institutions like governments must play in promoting peace, Member States also affirmed that strong governance and partnership is essential to realising peace as a prerequisite for development.<br/><br/>“We recognise that sustainable development cannot be realised without peace and security, and peace and security will be at risk without sustainable development,” it stated.<br/><br/>Plan of Action<br/><br/>In the midst of challenges to multilateralism, Member States said that the declaration was an affirmation of the UN’s commitment to multilateralism, which is celebrating its 80th anniversary this year.<br/><br/>“At a time when serious doubts about the future of multilateralism persist, your steadfast commitment has been both reassuring and inspiring,” said Mr. Kulhánek.<br/><br/>Member States, in the declaration, affirmed a commitment to urgently working towards the SDGs in order to achieve a better world. <br/><br/>“We will act with urgency to realise its vision as a plan of action for people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership, leaving no one behind.”<br/><br/>ECOSOC High-Level Segment<br/><br/>The Declaration also was adopted a day later during the closing of the ECOSOC High-Level Segment, which included the three-day HLPF ministerial segment.<br/><br/>Mr. Li noted that the proceedings took place at a time of profound global uncertainty, but also immense possibility.<br/><br/>He praised the Council’s efforts to respond to global challenges “not with despair, but with determination and decisive action, highlighting how it has brought together governments, the UN system, and other stakeholders to advance dialogue on issues such as financing for development, artificial intelligence, displacement, and the empowerment of women and girls.<br/><br/>Differences, dialogue and solutions<br/><br/>ECOSOC President Bob Rae acknowledged that the adoption of the Ministerial Declaration was achieved after much hard work, and the differences of opinion expressed must not be ignored.<br/><br/>“Let's be clear,” he said.  “Equality among all of us – regardless of gender, race, colour or creed – is foundational to sustainable development, to human rights and to the credibility of our multilateral system.”<br/><br/>Mr. Rae stressed the urgent need for renewed dialogue, which requires courage and leadership.  He pointed to the UN Charter, saying it “strikes a balance between the rights of sovereign states and the universality of other freedoms and rights, and that is the balance that we must continue to strike.”<br/><br/>This is why ECOSOC must lead, he said, not just as a platform for dialogue but “as a driver of solutions, of implementation and results,” especially for those members of the global community who are the furthest behind.<br/><br/>“There are so many who today are living in stress, on the edge of poverty and in the midst of starvation,” he said.  “We need to understand that our task, and our hearts and our minds, must always be those who are living on the margins.”<br/><br/></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165486'>https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165486</a></p>",

    "news_content": "<p>30 July 2025<br/><br/>Southeast and East Asia plays a central role in the global effort to tackle plastic pollution, given its substantial share of the global economy, strategic position in plastics value chains and rapidly rising plastics demand, according to a new OECD report.<br/><br/>The Regional Plastics Outlook for Southeast and East Asia – focusing on ASEAN Plus Three (APT) countries, comprising the 10 ASEAN Member States as well as the People’s Republic of China (China), Japan and Korea – shows that plastics use in the region has surged almost nine-fold since 1990, reaching 152 million tonnes (Mt) in 2022.<br/><br/>The region now accounts for almost one-third of global plastics use, with annual per capita use ranging from 32 kg in lower middle-income countries to over 100 kg in many upper middle- and high-income countries in the APT region. In 2022, the region leaked 8.4 Mt of plastics into the environment – over one-third of the global total, including 3.5 Mt from ASEAN Member States and 4.9 Mt from China. Plastic leakage refers to any plastic that enters the terrestrial or aquatic environment, resulting from inadequate collection and disposal. This includes plastic waste, such as packaging or beverage cups, that is littered or openly dumped.<br/><br/>The report finds that by 2050, plastics use is projected to reach 280 Mt per year, with plastic leakage projected to increase by 68% to 14.1 Mt per year. The report presents a High Stringency scenario that shows how comprehensive action across the plastic lifecycle could reduce use by 28%, more than quadruple regional recycling rates to 54%, and reduce mismanaged waste by 97% in the region by 2050, compared to Baseline projections.<br/><br/>“Southeast and East Asia can become a global model in tackling plastic pollution and advancing circular economy solutions for plastic waste,” said OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann. “With stronger regional co-operation, ambitious policies and targeted investments, the region can almost completely eliminate plastic leakage by 2050, delivering lasting benefits for people, the environment and the global economy.”<br/><br/>The estimated macroeconomic cost of a High Stringency scenario – equivalent to 0.8% of regional GDP in 2050 – is unevenly distributed. ASEAN lower middle-income countries face a steeper cost (2.8% of GDP on average), underscoring the need for enhanced regional co-operation and international support.<br/><br/>Despite challenges, including rising waste generation that outpaces waste management in a region that is highly diverse in terms of income levels, plastics use and capacity to manage it, significant progress is being made. Most APT countries have adopted national action plans on plastic pollution and stepped up regional co-operation. The average recycling rate in the region (12%) already exceeds the global average (10%), and efforts are underway to improve waste segregation at source, reduce littering and increase the use of recycled materials in manufacturing.<br/><br/>Effective strategies can be further tailored to local contexts and supported by investments in waste collection and recycling infrastructure, stronger regulatory frameworks, clear policy signals to unlock investments and support for the integration of informal waste workers.<br/><br/>The report will be launched during a Green Talk LIVE webinar today, 30 July at 10:00 - 11:15 CEST.

Increasing heat episodes are also leading to health issues for vulnerable populations in developing countries, such as children, older adults and low-income populations.<br/><br/>“Heat stress is already harming the health and livelihoods of billions of workers, especially in the most vulnerable communities,” said Dr Jeremy Farrar, WHO Assistant Director-General, Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Care. “This new guidance offers practical, evidence-based solutions to protect lives, reduce inequality, and build more resilient workforces in a warming world.”<br/><br/>The new report and technical guidance, entitled Climate change and workplace heat stress draws on five decades of research and evidence, highlighting that the health and productivity of workers are severely impacted by rising temperatures. WMO reports that 2024 was the hottest year on record. Daytime temperatures of more than 40°C and even above 50°C are becoming increasingly common, a clear indication that immediate action is needed to address the worsening impact of heat stress on workers worldwide.<br/><br/>“Occupational heat stress has become a global societal challenge, which is no longer confined to countries located close to equator – as highlighted by the recent heatwave in Europe,” said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett. “Protection of workers from extreme heat is not just a health imperative but an economic necessity.”<br/><br/></p><p>Source:<a target='_blank' href='https://www.who.int/news/item/22-08-2025-who-wmo-issue-new-report-and-guidance-to-protect-workers-from-increasing-heat-stress'>https://www.who.int/news/item/22-08-2025-who-wmo-issue-new-report-and-guidance-to-protect-workers-from-increasing-heat-stress</a></p>",
