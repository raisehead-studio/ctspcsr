    "news_content": "<p>Consultation underway for GRI Climate Change and Energy Standards On the eve of the UN COP28 climate change summit, GRI has published draft versions of two standards that will be central to how organizations around the world commit to greater accountability for their climate change impacts.</p>\n<p>A public comment period is underway to seek global feedback on a proposed new GRI Topic Standard for Climate Change, as well as an updated GRI Energy Standard. Responding to emerging disclosure expectations on climate change, the key focus in the exposure drafts is on how organizations can cut their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and reduce energy consumption, in ways that support the principles of a just transition.As confirmed in the UNFCCC global stock-take, the world is not on track to meet the Paris Agreement goals, with calls for action to be rapidly accelerated. Given that the credibility of climate change targets and pledges made   by organizations is increasingly scrutinized, the exposure drafts explicitly asks them to explain how their actions relate to the Paris Agreement’s central aim to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius.The drafted Climate Change Standard will enable organizations to:</p></p><ul><li>Fully disclose climate change transition and adaption plans and actions;</li><li>Detail annual progress on emissions reduction targets; and</li><li>Robustly explain and be transparent about their use of carbon credits and GHG removals.</li></ul><p>Importantly, it has a new disclosure on the social aspect of climate change, emphasizing accountability for impacts on workers, communities and vulnerable groups. It also draws strong parallels between the inter-connected topics of climate change and biodiversity.</p><p>Meanwhile, the exposure draft for a revised Energy Standard has a sharp focus on the ways in which organizations are reducing energy consumption, achieving energy efficiency and sourcing renewable energy – all of which are essential to combat climate change and ensure companies tangibly demonstrate how they are decreasing their carbon footprint.</p><p>Carol Adams, Chair of the Global Sustainability Standards Board (GSSB) – the independent body that sets the GRI Standards – said:</p><p><em>“The scientific evidence and international consensus is unequivocal: climate change threatens humanity’s well-being and the planet's health. That is why there are growing demands for organizations to provide in-depth information about how they are reducing GHG emissions, taking concrete steps to mitigate and adapt to climate change – and how their actions impact on people and the environment.The review by GRI of climate change-related Standards reflects stakeholder expectations, including from investors. In advance of crucial decisions and new commitments being made at COP28, it’s significant that these exposure drafts are available for consultation, paving the way for robust and globally comparable reporting by organizations on their climate change and energy related impacts.”</em></p><p>The public comment period is open until 29 February 2024, with the final standards expected to be published before the end of 2024. Global webinars to present the exposure drafts are taking place on 28 November – at 9 am CET and 5 pm CET – and free places can now be booked. This will be followed by specific Q&A sessions in January, further details on which will be shared in the coming weeks.The exposure drafts have been developed by a multi-stakeholder and independent Technical Committee. As the climate and energy topics are closely interrelated, a decision was taken for the standards to be co-developed by the same experts, supported by an appointed subgroup, with a joint decision-making process used to achieve close alignment.The review of climate change related GRI Standards was commissioned and overseen by the Global Sustainability Standards Board, following a defined Due Process Protocol. Following the public comment period, the draft Standards will be refined before approval by the GSSB, ensuring the final versions meet multi-stakeholder expectations and follow internationally accepted best practice for disclosure of climate and energy related impacts.To ensure GHG emissions reporting in the draft Climate Change Standard is based on the latest insights of the GHG Protocol standards and guidance, the GHG Protocol team is part of the Technical Committee. Cooperation and review of the drafts has taken place, and will be continued, with EFRAG, some national standard setters and the ISSB, to achieve alignment with their respective climate-related disclosures.The Energy exposure draft proposes an update to GRI 302: Energy 2016. The Climate Change exposure draft brings together new disclosures as well as reviewing and updating climate change related content from GRI 305: Emissions 2016 and GRI 201: Economic Performance 2016.</p>\n",

However, with passenger mobility demand set to increase, electrification alone will not suffice and must be coupled with increasing transport efficiency. Furthermore, increasing restrictions on the circulation of ICE vehicles in urban centers, new mobility solutions enabled by emerging technologies and new commuting patterns are setting the stage for a new mobility paradigm.<br /><br />Urban transport planners, mobility providers and businesses with sustainable employee mobility strategies are striving to promote sustainable new mobility solutions. How can they facilitate commuter’s shift to sustainable transport modes (modal shift)? And what infrastructure and policies should they prioritize for maximum impact?<br /><br />Mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) is an emerging digital mobility solution that can radically improve transport efficiency by integrating multiple transport modes into a more efficient and user-centered mobility offer. The real environmental impact of MaaS will depend on its ability to motivate modal shift and commuter choices at a large scale.<br /><br />In a new digital collaboration initiative announced today by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Transport & Mobility Pathway, Arcadis and Fujitsu have developed digital solutions for municipalities and businesses to optimize the deployment of multimodality and new mobility solutions with regards to modal shift and sustainable mobility.<br /><br />The use cases will apply Arcadis’ Mobility Hubs module and Fujitsu’s Social Digital Twin technology. They will test how different transport planning scenarios promote multimodal and sustainable commuting. The scenarios under study are adjusted parking fees and the creation of mobility hubs, to be evaluated based on their effect on modal shift and associated cost and time of travel and transport-related emissions. The simulation will be carried out in the Greater London Region with data from Transport for the South-East (TfSE) and Michelin Mobility Intelligence. Results from an initial simulation by Fujitsu demonstrated potential for 12% CO2 reduction through commuters’ shift to more sustainable transport modes.<br /><br />Data sharing and digital collaboration to maximize the impact of MaaS<br /><br />Digital collaboration among all MaaS stakeholders will ensure that cities and MaaS operators can expand the scope of mobility services to facilitate traveler access and maximize transport efficiency and decarbonization benefits.<br /><br />With extensive access to disaggregated data from across the spectrum of MaaS stakeholders, cities and mobility providers can design MaaS based on more accurate predictions of mobility patterns and how they are set to evolve.<br /><br />Besides the basic functional blocks to facilitate route planning, MaaS operators can create valuable additional service modules by integrating assets such as user profiles for personalization or booking and payment platforms to centralize ticketing.<br /><br />Although often left out of MaaS design, private car data is an essential module. Transport planners need a better understanding of the needs and preferences of drivers – particularly in more remote or underserved regions – to effectively influence modal choice and optimize infrastructure investments in the electric vehicle (EV) era. MaaS operators can significantly contribute to sustainable mobility strategies by integrating EV charging locations and pre-booking in their service offerings.<br /><br />Private car data integration is a key element of the collaborative digital solutions developed by Arcadis and Fujitsu.<br /><br />“It’s been a pleasure working with Fujitsu, Michelin Mobility Intelligence and TfSE and we recognise the importance of working collaboratively with organisations to accelerate a planet positive future. Private car use data is often a missing ingredient of MaaS applications, but the reality is that many people continue to rely on their car in part for some journeys. We wanted to explore how including this data could influence peoples travel behaviour in a multimodal digital environment to optimize the environmental and social impact of these journeys,” commented Simon Swan, Global Solutions Director, New Mobility at Arcadis.<br /><br />What's next?<br /><br />Thanks to seamless integration and the right digital solutions for modeling, cities and businesses can harness the full potential of MaaS as an accelerator of their respective Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans and sustainable commuting policies.<br /><br />Mayors, governors and parliamentarians, business and civil society leaders will gather for COP28 in Dubai and agree on the next climate action steps, with a thematic focus on transport scheduled for December 6. They must integrate new digital and mobility solutions, such as MaaS, as powerful tools for sustainable mobility. Integrating digitalization in transport decarbonization pathways starts with the introduction of the right digital governance frameworks, and with investments in governments and businesses’ capacity to engage in data sharing and digital collaboration.<br /><br />The WBCSD Transport & Mobility Pathway gathers companies to accelerate transport decarbonization and promote data sharing and digitalization as core solutions for the transition to sustainable mobility. Fifteen of our member companies are building a data-sharing coalition to bolster new digital solutions for the transition to zero-emission mobility. Earlier this year, they demonstrated how digital collaboration across the electric mobility value chain could accelerate the deployment of charging infrastructure toward transport climate goals. In early 2024, they will release a digital framework for accelerating the deployment of MaaS, promoting sustainable urban mobility.

For networking to function across the entire agrifood value chain, standards and specifications are key. They specify interfaces and uniform data formats and allow open access to new technologies.<br /><br />This is where international standards on smart farming come in, where ground-breaking work has been undertaken, in the form of a roadmap, to identify existing needs and the direction of standards development in the coming years for the agrifood sector.<br /><br />Together with ISO, the German Institute for Standardization (DIN) will be presenting this Roadmap on Smart Farming at Agritechnica – the world’s leading agricultural trade fair – in Hanover from 12 to 18 November 2023. The two organizations will be sharing a stand in Hall 15 (Stand J37) and showcasing the value of standards and specifications across the entire agrifood value chain.<br /><br />Standardization roadmap on smart farming<br /><br />This Roadmap was developed by the ISO Strategic Advisory Group (SAG) on Smart Farming, a group of ISO experts under the joint leadership of ANSI and DIN, the respective ISO members for the USA and Germany. As part of the work, 150 experts from 20 countries analysed the standardization landscape along the entire food value chain. Nine thematic areas were examined in relation to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): crop production, livestock, urban farming, terminology and semantics, social aspects, supply chains, original equipment manufacturers, climate adaptation, environment and data.<br /><br />The key part of the roadmap is the extensive recommendations for new standardization projects across the entire agricultural and food chains as well as structural recommendations for international cooperation. Development focuses on uniform agricultural semantics and fundamental requirements for data-driven systems in the agrifood sector. The primary emphasis is on standardizing agricultural data types, with the creation of a data type registry to facilitate the exchange of data. This creates a unified data reference architecture in the agrifood value chain.<br /><br />At the conclusion of the work on the Roadmap for Smart Farming, Christoph Winterhalter, DIN Executive Board Chairman and ISO Vice-President (Policy), said: “Standardization can help to harness the full potential of technology in agricultural and agrifood value creation. By considering not only agricultural production but also the upstream and downstream production and distribution of food, we can now, for the first time, provide a comprehensive and structured recommendation of necessary standardization needs and translate them into concrete projects.”<br /><br />Sergio Mujica, ISO Secretary-General, commented: “Cooperation among the various institutions and experts is key for the vast and constantly expanding field of smart farming. The ISO SAG on Smart Farming has made it possible for the first time to compile on an international level a standardization roadmap for the agrifood sector. We are looking forward to starting work within our new technical committee in early 2024 to bring these ideas to fruition.”<br /><br />International cooperation in smart farming<br /><br />ISO has created a new technical committee (ISO/TC 347) on data-driven agrifood systems, aiming to improve interoperability in the agricultural sector and to respond to the needs highlighted in the roadmap. All ISO national standards bodies can contribute to this work, which will start in April 2024.<br /><br />Talks on standardization at Agritechnica<br /><br />Interested parties can find out more about the results of the Standardization Roadmap and the topic of smart farming at Agritechnica on 15 and 17 November.<br /><br />15 November 2023 at 3:30 pm: In the exposition area for industry experts (System & Components), DIN and ANSI, the US standards institute, will be jointly presenting on stage the results of the ISO Strategy Advisory Group (SAG) and the new ISO/TC 347, Data-driven agrifood systems.<br /><br />17 November 2023 at 4:30 pm: DIN activities on smart farming will also be presented to the audience on one of the DLG technical stages. Joint discussions on how agriculture can contribute to making Europe climate neutral will also take place.<br /><br />About DIN<br /><br />DIN, the German Institute for Standardization, is the independent platform for standardization in Germany and worldwide. As a partner for industry, research and society as a whole, DIN plays a major role in supporting the marketability of innovative solutions through standardization – be it in topics around the digitization of business and society or in the context of research projects. More than 36 500 experts from industry, research, consumer protection and the public sector bring their expertise to work on standardization projects managed by DIN.<br /><br />About ISO<br /><br />ISO is an international organization with a membership of 169 national standards bodies. Through its global network, it facilitates the development of voluntary and market-relevant International Standards that support innovation, sustainability, and global trade.<br /><br />Source: <a target='_blank' href='https://www.iso.org/news/supporting-agrifood-systems</a></p>",
