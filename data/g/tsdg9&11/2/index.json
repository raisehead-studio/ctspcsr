    "<p>CTSP Park is committed to promoting the sustainable environment, hoping to achieve symbiosis and co-prosperity with environmental protection since development. Many achievements have been achieved in the buildings in the parks under its jurisdiction. In addition to continuing the work of 'CTSP Taiwan Park Eco-community Certification  (-EEWHEC)' in 2020 and obtaining the diamond-level eco-community green building label certificate, the Bureau became the fifth community in Taiwan to obtain the diamond-level label. By 2023, 12 buildings had obtained the EEWH diamond-level green building label, one gold-level green building label and eight bronze-level green buildinglabels.</p>",
    "<p>CTSP Bureau officially obtained the certificate of green building label for diamond-level ecological community in May 2020. The development of the park was carried out by 'phased development' and 'ecological construction method'. Starting from the health and comfort of life, it carried out a comprehensive and systematic environmental protection design for the park environment, emphasizing symbiosis and common prosperity with the environment. In 2022 and 2023, the carbon reduction benefits reached 10,120 tons and 6,942 tons respectively. In addition to continuing to provide energy-saving counseling to manufacturers, the bureau also attaches great importance to the green coverage rate of the park, and invites professional manufacturers to plant and maintain green plants in the park, which not only beautifies the landscape benefits of the park, but also achieves the effect of reducing carbon.</p>",

CTSP Bureau continuously plans the landscape improvement project of the park every year, and continuously maintains the existing green belt. Therefore, the legal open space in each building base is set as concentrated as possible to cooperate with the shrinking space for greening, and the effect of carbon reduction is achieved by counseling the park manufacturers to save electricity. In 2023, 3,882 arbor trees and 110 shrubs were newly planted. 373 plants, carbon sequestration capacity is 223 metric tons/ year, and the ecological green network connects parks and green spaces in the park with an area of about 239 hectares, accounting for more than 37% of the park area. Combined with the ecological flood detention pool park and the public open system planned before  the development of each park, it forms a circular green belt boundary of each base, with a bicycle lane of about 6 kilometers. Nowadays, Taichung Park has become one  of the routes for many cyclists to relax on holidays, and the park green spaces in each park have also become an important rest environment for residents in the surrounding communities.</p>",
