    "<h4>1. Energy Saving, Energy Creation</h4>",
    "<p>In order to achieve the goals and requirements of the Executive Yuan's energy-saving and carbon- reduction project, this Bureau implemented power-saving measures including replacing power- saving lamps, controlling the number of light sources in the Bureau according to the time of use, replacing a total of 560 sets of LED grille-type lamps (2 feet and 4 lamps) , and using air conditioners, set the indoor air-conditioning temperature to 26-28 degrees, increased the ice melting temperature and shorten the air-conditioning opening time. The annual electricity consumption has been decreasing year by year from 2.02 million kWh since 2009. According to statistics, the total annual electricity consumption of 2022 and 2023 is 1.64 and 1.67 million kWh, compared with 2009, with an annual decrease of 18.6% and 17.3%.</p>",
    "<p>CTSP Bureau carries out statistics, management and dispatching of water and electricity consumption for users in NSTC Science Park in accordance with the Measures for the Control of Water and Electricity Counseling. In order to alleviate the overall electricity consumption increasement of the park, the bureau continues to provide counseling and publicity on electricity saving. Since 2014, CTSP Bureau has continuously implemented on-the-spot energy-saving guidance for park manufacturers and has handled 42 sessions so far. With an energy saving potential totaling 125,579 MWh per year, and potential annual energy saving increase target of 4.3 MWh. The water consumption data of the park in the past three years are as follow:</p>",
    "<div class='page_photo_container'><img alt='' src='/images/e/tsdg7/1/en/photo1.png'  title=''></div>",
    "<p>In response to the 'Solar Photovoltaic Project' launched by the Executive Yuan, CTSP and the Park manufacturers are committed to promoting solar power generation, making good use of the existing Park plant construction area, making the most effective space planning and utilization between land and buildings, and improving the environment to practice the concept of symbiosis between the science Park and the land, and gradually to promote the diversification of energy and sustainability development. On November 8, 2023, the 'Solar Photovoltaic Installation Promotion and Information Seminar and Matchmaking Meeting' was held to encourage manufacturersin the Park to strengthen the installation of solar photovoltaic facilities. By the end of 2023, the total installation capacity of the park will be 59.93MW.</p>",
    "<h4>2. Strengthen the toughness of power system</h4>",
    "<p>On March 3, 2022, due to the failure of Taipower equipment, some manufacturers in the CTSP Park experienced a power voltage drop, but fortunately, there was no serious impact on the production line. In response to various power accidents, the bureau has already handled the power quality improvement plan in the Park, discussed the power quality of the park, and carried out research and analysis. From the power supply side of power plants, transmission and distribution, substations and the power equipment of the park manufacturers, the improvement countermeasures were proposed, which can optimize the power quality of the park and improve the reliability of power supply stability.</p>",
    "<p>In the future, a smart grid will be built in the newly-built park, and the practice of promoting and advising the park manufacturers to apply smart grid is put forward. At present, 15 factories in the park have completed the construction of energy management systems, among which the introduction penetration rate of manufacturers with electricity consumption above 25,000KW in the park is 100%. In addition, the bureau evaluates the feasibility of setting up an energy storage demonstration site by itself or cooperating with manufacturers. At present, the cumulative amount of energy storage system built in grid-connected 6.8MWh has been submitted to Taipower for impact audit.</p>"
