    "<p>中科管理局為維護園區之永續環境，透過實施總量管制及許可審查，掌握投資行為對園區整體的影響度，以符合環境影響評估書件內容及審查結論與承諾事項，後續則進行現場查核及追蹤，進一步要求園區廠商做好自主管理工作，共同維護園區環境品質。</p>",
    "<p>中部科學園區是一個執行總量管制園區，欲進駐之事業在投資申請階段即須提出個別污染總量預估，正式進駐後核配總量若需增加，應再次申請變更，本局將視園區整體總量核配情形辦理准駁，並彙報所在地地方主管</p>",
    "<p>為便利園區廠商環保許可申請，園區內採單一窗口機制辦理，本局自 2003 年起陸續向環境部申請委託辦理各園區許可審查業務，讓進駐園區之廠商可以快速取得生產所需之各項環保許可證文件。2022 至 2023 年共受理 338 件環保文件申請，通過案件共 319 件 ( 含 2021年申請於 2022 年或 2023 年通過 )，未通過案件係為退回廠商補正或案件尚於申請程序中。</p>",

    "<p>而為了進一步瞭解環評書件以外各項環境因子之現況，本局於 2022 至 2023 年增加補充監測部份項目，其中包含空氣品質、噪音振動、放流水水質、地面水質、地下水質等項目，2022 至 2023 年共增加進行 1,169 點次環境監測項目。</p>",
    "<div class='page_photo_container'><img alt='' src='/images/g/tsdg6&12/tsdg6/zh/photo8.png'  title=''></div>",
    "<p>此外，為了提高監測數據之可信度，本局 2022 至 2023 年亦執行平行監測，其中包含一般空氣品質、酸鹼氣、異味、煙道檢測 ( 含夜間檢測 )、民井水質等項目，不定期進行同步檢測，確保監測數據品質；同時為瞭解廠商夜間排放情形，2022 至 2023 年會同環保監督小組委員 ( 當地里長 ) 共執行 6 次夜間煙道抽查檢測，檢測結果並無異常。希望透過不定期檢測，可以確實瞭解園區營運對環境之影響。</p>"

    "<h4>1. Environmental review and audit</h4>",
    "<p>In order to maintain the sustainable environment of the park, CTSP Bureau grasps the impact of investment behavior on the whole park by implementing total amount control and license review, so as to meet the contents of environmental impact assessment documents, review conclusions and commitments, and then conducts on-site inspection and tracking, further requiring park manufacturers to do their own management work and jointly safeguard the environmental quality of the park.</p>",
    "<p>Central Taiwan Science Park is a park that implements total amount control. Enterprises that want to enter the park must put forward estimates of the total amount of individual pollution at the investment application stage. If the total amount of approved distribution needs to be increased after the official entry, they should apply for change again. The bureau will handle the approval according to the total amount of approved distribution in the park, and report it to the local competent authorities. There were 108 cases of total amount of pollution application and change in 2022-2023, and 104 cases passed.</p>",
    "<p>In order to facilitate the application of environmental protection permits by park manufacturers, the single window mechanism is adopted in the park. Since 2003, the Bureau has successively applied to the Ministry of the Environment to entrust the examination of permits in various parks, so that the manufacturers stationed in the park can quickly obtain various environmental protection permit documents required for production. From 2022 to 2023, a total of 338 applications for environmental protection documents were accepted, and 319 cases were passed (including the application in 2021, which was passed in 2022 or 2023). The cases that failed were returned to the manufacturer for correction or the cases were still in the application process.</p>",
    "<div class='page_photo_container'><img alt='' src='/images/e/tsdg6&12/1/en/photo1.png'  title=''></div>",
    "<p>In 2022-2023, CTSP Bureau conducted a total of 465 licensing audits to find out whether the business units really fulfilled the licensing contents. If this bureau finds that the business units do not conform to the licensing contents, this bureau will immediately send a letter asking the business units to make improvements and submit relevant application documents to handle the licensing changes or changes, and also carry out the auditing of recycling institutions. The staff of this bureau and experts and scholars in related fields will assist in the auditing operation to ensure that the recycling institutions outside the park properly handle the industrial wastes in the park and prevent the outside people from recognizing them as polluting the environment.</p>",
    "<div class='page_photo_container'><img alt='' src='/images/e/tsdg6&12/1/en/photo2.png'  title=''></div>",
    "<p>At night or on holidays, the Bureau conducts sampling and testing of flue gas from the factory owners in the park, and monitors whether the exhaust gas discharged by the factory owners in the park complies with laws and regulations through qualified testing institutions certified by the Ministry of the Environment. The test results from 2022 to 2023 were in compliance with relevant regulations.</p>",
    "<div class='page_photo_container'><img alt='' src='/images/e/tsdg6&12/1/en/photo3.png'  title=''></div>",
    "<p>The bureau sets up a toll-free environmental complaint hotline 0800-777795 to provide 24-hour service, and conducts on-site inspections and handling operations. In 2022-2023, it accepted 13 complaints from the public, including 7 complaints about air pollution, 4 complaints about noise, 1 complaint about water pollution and 1 complaint about waste. The bureau immediately handled the complaints after receiving them. All the complaints in 2022-2023 have been closed.</p>",
    "<h4>2. Centralized sewage treatment</h4>",
    "<p>All CTSP parks have established a perfect rainwater and sewage diversion sewer system, and the acceptance rate of industrial sewage in the park reaches 100%. The wastewater is properly treated by the sewage treatment plant and discharged only after it meets the national discharge water and environmental impact assessment standards. The rainwater sewer system not only collects rainwater in public areas, but also manufacturers must design rainwater collection pipelines when building factories, and set rainwater discharge ports to be incorporated into the rainwater sewer system, which will be discharged into the flood detention basin in the park and then merged into the receiving water body. The Bureau also regularly arranges sampling inspection plans for sewage and sewer systems in various parks to understand the system conditions and ensure the normal water quality.</p>",
    "<div class='page_photo_container'><img alt='' src='/images/e/tsdg6&12/1/en/photo4.png'  title=''></div>",
    "<p>The sewage treatment plants in the park are all three-stage treatment systems, adopting standard biological treatment units of activated sludge (AO biological nitrogen removal system and contact aeration method adopted by Taichung and Houli sewage plants), and adding chemical coagulation and physical filtration treatment units in subsequent units to improve the treated water quality and reduce the impact on the bearing water body.</p>",
    "<p>The operators of Zhongxing Park are mainly research and experimental industries, and no process wastewater is generated. The laboratory wastewater from the manufacturers in the park is cleared and treated by qualified manufacturers, and the domestic sewage is brought into the sewage sewer of the park and transported to Zhongzheng Road Sewage Treatment Plant for proper treatment and then discharged.</p>",

    "<div class='page_photo_container'><img alt='' src='/images/e/tsdg6&12/1/en/photo6.png'  title=''></div>",
    "<h4>3. Environmental quality monitoring</h4>",
    "<p>In order to effectively prevent pollution discharge and minimize the impact of park operation on the environment, CTSP Bureau conducts environmental monitoring every year according to the environmental monitoring plan contained in the environmental assessment document, including air quality, noise and vibration, water quality of discharge water, surface water quality, groundwater quality, sediment, soil, ecology, traffic volume and cultural assets, etc., with a total of 4,338 points/times from 2022 to 2023. The environmental monitoring results of our  bureau are all open and transparent, and published on the CTSP Park Environmental Information Integration Network for public browsing.</p>",
    "<p>In order to further understand the current situation of environmental factors other than environmental assessment documents, the bureau added some supplementary monitoring items from 2022 to 2023, including air quality, noise and vibration, water quality of discharged water, surface water quality and groundwater quality, and conducted a total of 1,169 additional environmental monitoring points/times from 2022 to 2023.</p>",
    "<div class='page_photo_container'><img alt='' src='/images/e/tsdg6&12/1/en/photo7.png'  title=''></div>",
    "<p>In addition, in order to improve the reliability of monitoring data, the Bureau also carried out parallel monitoring in 2022-202 3, including general air quality, acid and alkali gas, odor, flue detection (including night detection), water quality of civilian wells and other items, and carried out synchronous testing from time to time to ensure the quality of monitoring data. At the same time, in order to understand the night emission situation of manufacturers, it conducted six flue spot night checks in 2022-2023 together with the Environmental Protection Supervision Subcommittee (local leader). It is hoped that the impact of park operation on the environment can be truly understood through irregular testing.</p>"
