    "<p>With the sustainable development of the park, the total amount of industrial waste has increased synchronously. The Bureau actively assists and counsels the park  anufacturers in waste reduction and recycling, provides suggestions on source reduction and waste recycling technology, and can substantially assist the park manufacturers in reducing the output of end waste, and selects and commends excellent units for waste reduction and resource recycling in the park. In 2022-2023, four excellent manufacturers and four excellent professionals were selected, and after the commendation, the excellent manufacturers were invited to share their experiences.</p>",
    "<p>In 2022-2023, a total of four applications for recycling were approved (two of which were pilot projects), and the recycling rate of waste in the parks under the jurisdiction of this bureau was increased to 96.1% (only off-site recycling), which was better than the recycling rate of industrial waste in the whole country. 193 waste inspections and publicity on source reduction were completed, and 2 publicity sessions on recycling technology and regulations were held.</p>",

    "<p>The Bureau cooperated with TSMC, an indicator manufacturer, to build a resource recycling (utilization) center in Taichung Park by using the land for environmental  protection facilities in the park, and recycled finished products with high-value recycling technology will be recycled to various manufacturers in the park or sold to the outside, which will help reduce the overall outsourcing of raw materials and outsourcing of abandoned resources in the park and gradually turn CTSP Park into an ecological park with 'resource recycling'. At present, the center plans to recycle three electronic products, two industrial products and one solvent zero waste. It is expected to operate in 2024 and in 2025, with a processing capacity of about 384 metric tons/day and an annual carbon reduction of about 40,000 tons, which is equivalent to the carbon absorption of 113 Da 'an Forest Parks.</p>",
