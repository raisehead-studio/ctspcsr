Among the above-mentioned 15 manufacturers, there are only five manufacturers in the first batch who should be checked and registered for greenhouse gas emissions (operation control, the base year is mainly based on the inventory of each factory), which is required to be completed the entire factory previous greenhouse gas emissions at the end of August each year.. For those inventory and registration of greenhouse gas emissions that are not required, there are 2 companies checked and registered by entrusting third- party inspections while the remaining 8 are checked independently.</p>",

Among the manufacturers in Houli Park, there are only 2 of the first batch of manufacturers that should check their registered greenhouse gas emissions (operational control rights; the base year is based on the inventory check of each factory), while the rest perform self-inspection.</p>",
    "<p>The above-mentioned CTSP Houli Park greenhouse gas inventory inspections are conducted in accordance with ISO 14064-1 and the greenhouse gas inspection guidelines. The carbon dioxide emission coefficient is calculated in accordance with the statistical method of the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidelines (referred to as IPCC 2006 Guidelines) formulated by the IPCC, and the GWP value according to the regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency. The warming potential of the fourth assessment report of the IPCC in 2006 should be adopted after 2016.</p>",

From 2022 to 2023, a total of 10 regulatory publicity briefing meetings, 2 chemical inspection publicity briefing meeting, 1 environmental protection seminar, 1 environmental protection related topic briefing meetings were held, and 31 on-site counseling meetings of experts and scholars in the park manufacturers were handled.</p>",
    "<p>In addition, the Bureau also provides consulting services on environmental protection business for park manufacturers. Through face-to-face communication with the industry or case-by-case counseling, we can understand the difficulties of the industry in the process of operation or in the writing of environmental protection documents, and then assist in finding solutions. From 2022 to 2023, we offered consulting services in a total of 2,539 cases. (Excluding summary regulatory consultation and case status inquiry)</p>",
