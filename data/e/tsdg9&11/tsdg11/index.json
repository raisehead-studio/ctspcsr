    "<p>園區週遭環境多為草生地或農耕地，紀錄到的物種大多屬普遍常見物種，因兩棲爬蟲類屬春夏季節繁殖，物種數量以春夏季節最多。水域監測地點為后里園區專管出水口及中興園區污水排放口承受水體下游，項目包含魚類、底棲生物、水生昆蟲、浮游動植物。2022 至 2023 年因為中科各園區致力於生態環境保育，使得生態調查結果增加許多物種棲息，未來也將繼續增進保育環境行動，讓更多物種願意前來，豐富園區棲地。</p>",

    "<p>Maintaining the ecology of the Park is one of the firm principles of the CTSP. In accordance with the EIA commitment, an ecological survey is carried out in each Park (Taichung, Houli, Erlin, and Zhongxing) on ​​ a regular basis every year, and the rich species in the Park are recorded. On the migration route of migratory birds in East Asia, the number of northern migratory birds that come to spend winter is often more than that of summer migratory birds that come here to breed in summer. In addition, some resident birds have the habit of descending migratory in winter, so it can be recorded in autumn and winter that most of them belong to winter migratory birds, or the descending migratory birds in winter. If the weather is warm in spring and summer, there are many species of resident birds.</p>",
    "<p>The surrounding environment of the Park is mostly grassland or farmland. Most of the recorded species are common species. Because amphibians and reptiles breed in spring and summer, the number of species is the largest in spring and summer. The monitoring site of the water area is the downstream water body of the specially-managed water outlet of Houli Park and the sewage discharge outlet of Zhongxing Park. The project includes fish, benthic organisms, aquatic insects, and phytoplankton. In 2021, because the various parks of CTSP are committed to ecological environment conservation, the ecological survey results have shown the habitat of increasing species. In the future, we will continue to promote environmental conservation, so that more species are willing to come and enrich the habitat of the Park.</p>",

In addition, the Bureau has also set up 13 nest boxes in Huwei Sewage Treatment Plant and Guangfu Elementary School (Huwei Town), which are mainly used for bat breeding, wintering and general habitat, and observed the biological utilization of East Asian house bat, Horikawa brown bat and Yellow Bat. In 2022 and 2023, the number of bat nest boxes used was 138 and 135 respectively.</p>",
