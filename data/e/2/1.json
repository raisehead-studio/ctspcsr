Since 2007, CTSP has organized water-saving counseling, and has handled 42 sessions so far, with a cumulative water-saving potential amount of 11.53 million tons/year, which can save about 7.2 Shigangba Reservoirs per year (the effective capacity of Shigangba Reservoir is 1.605 million tons), and can reduce the annual emissions of CO2e by 1,753 metric tons; In 2021, we had 1 water-saving counseling session, and the total water-saving potential amount was 52,195 tons/year. In addition, based on the CO2e emissions from every cubic meter of water announced by the Taiwan Water Corp., when converted to the benefits of the energy conservation and carbon reduction measures, each ton of water saved can reduce CO2e emissions by approximately 0.152 kg, reducing7.93 metric tons of CO2e per year.",
