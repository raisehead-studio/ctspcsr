    "On June 6, 2018, the Act for Establishment and Administration of Science Parks was amended, the word 「industrial」 was deleted, the types of organizations that can be stationed in the Park were relaxed, and diversified types of innovative research and development businesses were introduced. Science parks no longer only emphasized the clustering of manufacturing industries, but that of technological innovation. In February 2020, in line with the amendment of the establishment and administration regulations, the Bureau officially held an unveiling ceremony to amend the name of the Park, deleting the word 「industrial」, which symbolized that the CTSP has reached a milestone in innovation based on the foundations laid in the past.",
    "Following the relaxation and revision of the regulations, by the end of 2021, 4 limited companies and 35 new manufacturers with a total investment of about NT$ 12.8 billion were introduced to the CTSP. In the future, the Park will regard technological innovation as its core value to guide industrial upgrading.",

The integrated circuit industry made up the largest amount of this turnover, followed by the Photoelectric industry, and then the precision machinery industry The integrated circuit industry benefited from increased demand for 5th generation mobile networks (5G), Artificial Intelligence (AI), automotive electronics and high-performance computing, resulting in a 7.41% increase in turnover. After three consecutive years of recession in the optoelectronic industry, driven by factors such as the home economy, long-distance business opportunities and the commercialization of Mini LED technology, the turnover increased significantly by 23.33%. Due to the increase in demand for home decoration in Europe and the United States, precision machinery industry turnover increased by 22.60%. In addition, the demand for nucleic acid testing in the biotechnology industry due to the epidemic is still strong, and the sales of testing products are booming, with turnover increasing by 18.41%.",
