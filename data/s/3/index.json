    "The CTSP Industry, Academia and Training Association was jointly established by CTSP and Chung Hsing University. It is one of the most important platforms for promoting industry, academia and training cooperation, promoting regional integration goals of industry-academia cooperation and establishing a cooperation network between manufacturers and the academic research community in Central Taiwan. Every year, the CTSP conducts forums, academic lectures and large-scale industry- academia employment fairs, etc., and will further continue to promote the industrial development of Central Taiwan and participate in industry academia innovation activities, indirectly promoting cooperation between academia and industry. Zhongxing University implements the industry-university-training technology exchange and matching plan of the CTSP Bureau, and in 2021, it held an CTSP online exchange symposium on industrial innovation-AI, intelligent manufacturing, optoelectronics, semiconductor fields, and discussed AI, intelligent manufacturing, optoelectronics, semiconductors and other fields from the perspective of industrial trends, hoping to provide a reference for the industrial development of park manufacturers, promote industrial transformation, and expand the effect of regional industrial settlements. In order to promote the development of industrial innovation and application, 2 innovative technology forums and 1 industry-university media exchange meeting were also held, where scholars from relevant fields from many universities were present to publish innovative research results, and experts from manufacturers inside and outside the Park and research institutions of foundations were invited to share development trends, technology applications and practical experience, and to build a research and development matching platform between academics and industries, taking this opportunity to enhance and activate the industrial energy of the Park.",
