    "On September 12, CTSP Intelligent Robot Self-Built Base held the WRO Future Engineer Competition to cultivate talents for AI autonomous driving, and a total of six schools competed. The winning team will compete in the 「WRO International Olympia Robot Online World Competition」 with students from 75 countries around the world to win the glory of Taiwan. The competition was based on AI autonomous driving, and the team needed to design its own AI autonomous driving car, judge whether there are obstacles in the surrounding environment through sensors, and complete the challenge in a limited time to obtain task scores. Through this activity, students can understand the principles and applications of autonomous driving, and can integrate the relevant topics related to AI autonomous driving, and challenge the mastery of core capabilities in AI autonomous driving.",
    "Since 2017, the CTSP has been committed to promoting robot education. In addition to handling FRC robot courses and competitions, it also actively cultivates students who are interested in robot-related aspects, and encourages young students to build self-confidence, learn professional knowledge and skills from competitions, and explore and stimulate more people's interest in the technology industry.",

    "<strong><ul><li>Build the FRC CTSP Alliance</li></ul></strong>",
    "CTSP Self-Built Base has always taken 「cultivating talents」 as the core policy. In 2021 due to the impact of COVID-19, most of the events were cancelled, but the Bureau still seized the time to make full preparations for the next season's events. In 2021 it opened the 「FRC National High School Vocational Winter Vacation Training Camp」 and 「Six Schools Invitational Tournament」 and promoted the 「FRC Member Machine Optimization and Upgrade Program」, providing participant equipment, professional practitioners, maker space and other open resources, hoping that the team can strengthen and upgrade robots with the assistance of all parties. In addition to strengthening the equipment, we also improve each other's strength through simulation matches. In order to promote the 「Intelligent Robot Innovation Self-Built Base - Cross-domain Intelligent Ecosystem Alliance」, the CTSP Bureau invited collaborative operators to enter the site, with the goal of building the self-built base into a multi-service platform, providing empirical field verification technology or solution , and creating an environment suitable for the work and exchange of new teams, and can also combine professional consultant teams to develop in the direction of intelligent manufacturing technology service alliance. At present, Atmospheric Plasma has joined the cooperative operation, which will provide more diversified and more commercial value technology and counseling services in the industry.",
