    "According to the Environmental Impact Assessment Enforcement Rules, the competent authority of the purposed business should track the activities during the process or after the completion of the development. Therefore, the Ministry of Science and Technology established an environmental impact assessment tracking team for the development of the science park, which is composed of experts, scholars, and representatives of the park manufacturers and agencies. In 2021 they performed 1 follow-up meetings to this Bureau.Before the development of the CTSP Park, the environmental impact assessment documents were submitted for review in accordance with the Environmental Impact Assessment Enforcement Rules, and the Environmental Impact Assessment briefing was handled in accordance with the procedures. Active communication with all walks of life, and the review was passed, the Environmental Assessment documents and commitments were indeed followed. Taichung, Houli and Erlin parks were all handled in accordance with the key points of environmental protection supervision, and an environmental protection supervision team was established. A total of 16 experts and scholars (including environmental engineering, soil and water conservation, and health risks), 13 NGO representatives, 24 local leaders and 4 representatives of local authorities, 4 representatives of manufacturers, and 61 external committee members participated in order to enhance the extensive participation of environmental protection supervision, regularly hold supervision meetings, and continue to track the development of the Park.",

    "This Bureau has set up a free environmental protection complaint hotline - 0800-777795, which is manned 24-hours a day by special personnel, and to then go to the scene to conduct inspections and handling operations. In 2021, a total of 10 complaints from the public were accepted, including 7 complaints about air, 2 for noises, and 1 of abandonment. The Bureau immediately went to deal with the issues after receiving the petitions. All petition cases in 2021 have been closed.",
    "<strong><ul><li>Environmental quality monitoring</li></ul></strong>",
    "In order to effectively prevent pollution emissions and minimize the impact of park operations on the environment, the CTSP Bureau conducts various environmental monitoring every year in accordance with the environmental monitoring plan contained in the EIA document, including airquality, noise, vibration, and water quality, surface water quality, groundwater quality, sediment, soil, ecology, traffic volume and cultural assets, etc. Of these, 1,963 monitoring sessions were conducted in 2021. The environmental monitoring results of this Bureau are open and transparent, and are published on the CTSP Park Environmental Information Integration Network for public viewing.",
    "In order to understand the current status of various environmental factors other than the environmental assessment documents, this Bureau added some supplementary monitoring points in 2021, including air quality, noise and vibration, discharge water quality, surface water quality, groundwater quality and other items, of which 829 monitoring sessions were carried out in 2021.",
    "<div class='page_photo_container'><img alt='' src='/images/en_image/report/g136.png'  title=''></div>",
    "In addition, in order to improve the credibility of the data, this Bureau also planned parallel monitoring in 2021, which included general air quality, acid-base gas, peculiar smells, flue detection (including night detection), civilian wells, etc., and synchronous detection is carried out from time to time, ensuring the quality of monitoring data. In order to understand the manufacturers’night emissions situation, on April 16、August 13 and December 13, 2021, this Bureau performed the night flue inspections together with the environmental protection supervision team members (local chiefs), and the test results were not abnormal. It is hoped that through irregular inspections, we can truly understand the impact of the Park operation on the environment.",
