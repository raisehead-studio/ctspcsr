    "In advocating occupational safety and health, counseling, and performing labor inspections, the Park adopts a one-stop service and advance safety assessment and guidance mechanism through information technology to strengthen business units' self-management and expansion of the full staff participation mechanism. In addition, diversified use of disaster prevention resources is utilized in order to effectively improve the overall safety and health standards of the Park, promote labor health and labor inspection efficiency, and construct a safe, healthy, and humanized labor environment. The health and safety status of workers in the CTSP in 2021 was as follows : There were 104 disabling injuries at a frequency rate of 1.09 and a severity rate of 15. There were 0 deaths attributed to work- related occupational disasters. In addition to conducting occupational disaster investigations in accordance with the law and writing a report to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the Ministry of Labor for review, counseling was given to the public institutions to make improvements and strengthening the concept of occupational safety and health. Related occupational disaster cases are expanded to publicize the knowledge of the park manufacturers to review similar risks in the factory and take preventive measures to prevent the same disaster from recurring. ",
    "<strong><ul><li>Occupational Safety Advocacy</li></ul></strong>",
    "In order to promote a culture of industrial safety in the Park, the CTSP Bureau actively counsels the CTSP Association for Occupational Safety and Health Promotion which is divided into seven major occupational safety families. Through the method of large factories leading small factories, regular meetings are held every quarter to promote safety and health laws, exchange disaster prevention information, share safety and health management experience, discuss chemical management and emergency response to accidents, and mutual support for rescue facilities, etc., giving full play to the role mutual support plays in emergency response to accidents.",

In 2021, there were a total of 17,370 outpatient visits. In addition to outpatient clinics, it also handles various health promotion advocacy such as first aid education and training for personnel, breast ultrasound exam, pap smear test, adult health exam, abdominal ultrasound, oral cancer prevention, sports, mental health, physical fitness, vaccination, and other lectures and consultations, etc. Professional medical doctors are also invited to the Park companies with 3,136 special consultations conducted in 2021 for the physical and mental health of the workers in the Park and improving the occupational health promotion work of the park manufacturers.",
    "<strong><ul><li>Disaster prevention drills in the Park</li></ul></strong>",
    "On November 1, 2021, the Bureau, together with the Environmental Protection Bureau of the Taichung Municipal Government and Nitto Optics Co., Ltd. of Taiwan, jointly held the 「2021 Annual Disaster Prevention and Response Drill of The CTSP」, in which the disaster situation caused an accidental collision between the stacker and the truck vehicle caused by an earthquake, resulting in the truck driver being trapped in the car, catching fire and the toxic chemical butyl acrylate leakage accident. Considering the epidemic situation and site restrictions, the number of on-site observers is limited, in order to allow those who cannot attend the scene to observe the drill process, for the first time, the drill process was synchronized on the network for online live broadcast, so that those who could not participate in the field observation could also participate in the drill together.This year's disaster prevention and rescue drills were affected by the epidemic, and the scale of the drills was reduced a lot, however, while fighting the epidemic, the work of disaster prevention and emergency response was still not neglected, and the drill process was very compact and realistic, which fully showed that when the accident occurred, the manufacturers completed the notification, fire extinguishing, leakage and other operations in a timely manner, and the manufacturers in the downwind also practiced emergency evacuation operations. After the relevant support units arrived at the factory, they immediately carried out personnel rescue, water mist protection, perimeter environmental detection and environmental reconnaissance. The CTSP also used the established chemical database to quickly grasp the chemical allocation around the scope of the accident and the number of rescue equipment that could be supported by the joint defense manufacturers, and provided relevant units to conduct disaster assessment and rescue strategies, so that the disaster could be controlled one step faster. The participating units included Taichung fire bureau, Environmental accident technical team of central district of Environmental Protection Department, Park police team, staff clinic, Taichung park sewage plant and joint defense manufacturers, etc., a total of 13 units, more than 60 people participated in the drill.",
