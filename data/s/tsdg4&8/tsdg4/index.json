    "<p>The integrated circuit industry is affected by the global economic environment, and the demand for terminal electronic products is weak. Customers continue to adjust their inventory and adopt more advanced processes, which makes the capacity utilization rate of manufacturers decline, resulting in a 23.40% decline in turnover. However,  anufacturers continue to lay out special processes and achieve differentiation through technological diversity to improve the capacity utilization rate. The photoelectric ndustry benefited from the reduction of global panel production capacity supply. Under the improvement of the supply and demand structure, the quotation of TV panels increased, which increased the turnover by 0.11%. In the precision machinery industry, customers are facing the pressure of destocking, and the purchase of equipment is elayed or the capital expenditure is reduced, resulting in a 7.69% decline in turnover. The biotechnology industry benefited from the gradual opening of the market for new drugs and the warming of the contact lens market, with a turnover increase of 15.12%; In addition, the beneficiary manufacturers of computer and its peripheral industries expanded their production capacity and the orders for electric bicycles in the US market increased, with a turnover growth of 21.27%.</p>",
