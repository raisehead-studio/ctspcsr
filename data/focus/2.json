    "In May 2021, the epidemic situation in Taiwan was upgraded to the third-level alert. In order to enable the manufacturers in the Park known as competitive moats, which are labeled as sacred mountains in CTSP, to operate smoothly, and to cooperate with the government's epidemic prevention policy, the CTSP Epidemic Prevention Team, the Ministry of Health Services, and the Health Bureau held regular epidemic prevention project meetings to develop epidemic prevention strategies. It was also actively handling COVID-19 screening and vaccination services with the Ministry of Science and Technology. It is hoped that through the contingency measures of CTSP, the Park will be able to build an epidemic safety net in the shortest time, so that manufacturers can still enjoy safety protection during the severe epidemic.",
