    "<p>行政院已訂定「開源」、「節流」、「調度」及「備援」等具體做法，並通過立法公布再生水資源發展條例，使得再生水成為產業用水策略的一個新選項，中科依據「再生水資源發展條例」及相關子法規定，中科與園區廠商共同推動水再生利用方案。</p>",

    "Although Taiwan has abundant rainfall, due to the narrow terrain and dense population, as well as the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall, Taiwan is the 18th water-deficient country in the world. In order to cope with the water shortage crisis under climate change, we must find ways to have a water source that is not affected by the weather, and that is recycled water. Taiwan has been promoting the construction of reclaimed water plants since 2013. With the increasing maturity of water treatment technology, it is sufficient to become one of the sharp tools for stabilizing water supply. The reclaimed water not only brings economic benefits, but also creates an industrial circular economy and achieves the vision of environmental sustainability.",
    "The Executive Yuan has formulated specific practices such as 「Diversification」, 「Reduction」, 「Dispatch」 and 「Backup」, and has passed legislation and promulgated regulations on the development of reclaimed water resources, making reclaimed water a new option for industrial water use strategies. The Regulations on the Development of Renewable Water Resources and related sub-laws stipulate that CTSP and the manu.",

    "The「Shuinan Water Resource Recycling Center Effluents Recycling and Reuse Plan」 is the first demonstration case of the use of reclaimed water from the out-of-Park system in the central region with an indicative meaning. On March 31, 2021, CTSP Bureau signed a water contract for reclaimed water with AUO, Lianfeng Precision and Yadong Industrial Gas Company. CTSP is also actively developing sustainable water resources to support the reclaimed water project. The water transmission and distribution pipelines in the Park will be synchronized with the reclaimed water plants outside the area to provide diversified water supply channels and retain opportunities for more water manufacturers to participate in the future. During the drought period, it can relieve the pressure of tap water supply, and achieve a win-win situation for regional water dispatch and industrial circular economy.",

    "Water source is an important lifeline for the technology industry. For manufacturers, reclaimed water is not affected by the weather and has the advantage of stable water supply. It can be used as a substitute or backup water for traditional water sources. It is hoped that manufacturers are willing to stay in Taichung to increase employment opportunities and cultivate talents, moving towards a sustainable environment.",
